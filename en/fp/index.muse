I'm working with functional programming languages for a long time.  Lisp was first
functional language, that I studied. Now I mostly program in [[../clojure][Clojure]], but also plays with
Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, Scheme and Common Lisp.

I'm author of [[../writings][many articles]], including articles on functional programming languages (many
of them in Russian, including, published in the Russian magazine called
"[[http://fprog.ru][Practice of functional programming]]".  I also translated to English my
[[./books/][review of existing literature on functional programming]] that was published
in the first issue of this magazine.
