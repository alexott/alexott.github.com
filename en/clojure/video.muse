On this page I tried to collect links to all existing video materials about Clojure --
video-lectures & tutorials, presentations at conferences, etc.  *if you have more links to
video materials, please leave them in comments to this page!*

 - http://clojure.blip.tv/ -- contains set of video-lectures & presentation about Clojure
   by Rich Hickey (and other developers).  Lectures like "Clojure for Lisp developers" &
   "Clojure for Java developers" could be used as introductions into this language;
 - [[http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Expert-to-Expert-Rich-Hickey-and-Brian-Beckman-Inside-Clojure/][Inside Clojure]] -- Rich Hickey's lectures for Channel 9 about Clojure internals;
 - [[http://vimeo.com/channels/fulldisclojure][Sean Devlin's screencasts]] about Clojure 1.1 features, project management, installing
   IDEs, macroses, etc.;
 - [[http://www.youtube.com/user/briantwill#g/c/AC43CFB134E85266][Intro to Clojure]] -- set of presentations about Clojure -- comprehensive introduction
   into language;
 - Stuart Halloway's lectures at [[http://oredev.org][Øredev]] conference: [[http://vimeo.com/10896148][Clojure's basics ]] and
   [[http://vimeo.com/8672404][Concurrent programming in Clojure]].  These lectures provides comprehensive introduction
   into language -- basic constructs, its design, problems of concurrent programming (*I
   really enjoyed watching these lectures*);
 - [[http://vimeo.com/11236603][Clojure 1.2 Protocols]] -- Stuart Halloway's screencast about data types & protocols in
   new version of Clojure (version 1.2);
 - [[http://link.pluralsight.com/clojure][Clojure Concurrency On-Demand!]] -- set of screencasts about concurrent programming in
   Clojure.  The first screencast contains pretty good introduction into Clojure programming;
 - [[http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-clojure][Rich Hickey on Clojure's Features and Implementation]] -- Rich Hickey's interview on QCon
   London 2009.  He narrates about STM, Clojure's internals, etc.;
 - [[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hickey-clojure][Clojure]] -- Rich Hickey's presentation about Clojure on JVM Languages Summit 2008;
 - [[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey][Are We There Yet?]] -- Rich Hickey's presentation on JVM Languages Summit 2009;
 - [[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey][Persistent Data Structures and Managed References]] -- Rich Hickey's presentation about
   persistent data structures, mutable state & how these things are implemented in
   Clojure;
 - [[http://www.infoq.com/interviews/stuart_holloway_clojure][Stuart Halloway on Clojure and Functional Programming]] -- author of
   "[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356336?ie=UTF8&tag=aleottshompag-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356336][Programming Clojure]]" talk about Clojure & FP;
 - [[http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/21-nov-2009-10-25-clojure-for-ruby-programmers-stuart-halloway.html][Clojure for Ruby Programmers]] -- lecture by Stuart Halloway on RubyConf 2009;
 - [[http://vimeo.com/9090935][Clojure in Clojure]] -- Rich Hickey's lecture (incomplete) about implementing Clojure in
   Clojure;
 - [[http://www.parleys.com/#st=5&id=1518&sl=1][Clojure: Functional Concurrency for the JVM]] -- lecture about Clojure by Howard M. Lewis
   on [[http://devoxx.com][Devoxx'09]];
 - [[http://vimeo.com/9770382][circumspec, inferior-lisp, clojure, and slime]] -- скринкаст Stuart Halloway;
 - [[http://peepcode.com/products/functional-programming-with-clojure][Functional Programming with Clojure]] -- screencast (requiring payment), that shows
   Clojure's features on example of game development (*I hadn't seen it, in contrast to
   other video-materials*).
