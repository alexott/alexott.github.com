<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1"></a>
What is CEDET?</h2>

<p class="first">The CEDET package is a collection of libraries, that implement different commands, but all
of them have common goal &mdash; provide functionality for work with source code written in
different programming languages (<em>please, take into account that not all of these packages
are included into CEDET bundled with GNU Emacs</em>):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Semantic</em> is a base for construction of syntactic analyzers for different programming
languages. It provides common representation of information extracted from code.  Using
this information, CEDET &amp; other packages, such as <a href="http://jdee.sourceforge.net/">JDEE</a> and <a href="http://ecb.sf.net">ECB</a>, can implement
functionality, required for modern development environment &mdash; name completion, code
navigation, etc.;</li>
<li><em>SemanticDB</em> is included into Semantic, and implements different storage modules, that
store information, needed for names completion, source code navigation, etc.  Syntactic
information may be saved between Emacs sessions, so this reduces need for re-parsing of
source code that wasn't modified since last parse;</li>
<li><em>Senator</em> implements navigation in source code using information extracted by Semantic;</li>
<li><em>Srecode</em> is a package for source code generation using syntactic information (including
information, extracted by Semantic);</li>
<li><em>EDE</em> implements a set of extensions to work with projects &mdash; user can control list of
the targets to build, build the project, etc.  Besides this, using the notion of the
project, you can have more precise control over Semantic's operations &mdash; name
completions, navigation, etc.;</li>
<li><em>Speedbar</em> is used to display information about current buffer using different sources of
information &mdash; Semantic, some specialized information providers (for texinfo &amp; HTML,
for example).</li>
<li><em>Eieio</em> is a library, that implements CLOS-like (Common Lisp Object System)
infrastructure for Emacs Lisp;</li>
<li><em>Cogre</em> is a library for generation of UML-like diagrams in Emacs buffer, with basic
integration with Semantic.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
CEDET's versions</h2>

<p class="first">We need to understand that there are several versions of CEDET, that differ from each
other by installation &amp; customization methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>standalone versions of CEDET up to version 1.1 (including) &mdash; these versions are
available for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cedet/files/">downloading from project's site</a>.  This version uses &quot;old&quot; layout for
source code &amp; activation method that isn't compatible with version included into GNU
Emacs.  In this version, files with source code often had &quot;long names&quot;, like
<code>semanticdb.el</code>, or <code>semantic-gcc.el</code>, and this made them incompatible with some of
operating systems supported by GNU Emacs;</li>
<li>standalone CEDET versions after 1.1 release &mdash; they use &quot;new&quot; directory layout and the
same activation method as in GNU Emacs, but these versions usually have more
functionality &amp; include some additional packages, like Senator.  In this version,
layout of source code was changed to match GNU Emacs, so some files was renamed: for
example, <code>semanticdb.el</code> was renamed to <code>semantic/db.el</code>, and <code>semantic-gcc.el</code> became
<code>semantic/bovine/gcc.el</code>, etc.</li>
<li>version that is bundled with GNU Emacs (starting with GNU Emacs 23.2) &mdash; some packages
aren't included into this version, and code could be &quot;outdated&quot;, comparing with current
standalone versions of CEDET.</li>
</ul>

<p>This article describes new version of CEDET, including version bundled with GNU Emacs.  If
you want to use standalone release 1.1, or earlier, then you need to read
<a href="EmacsCedetOld.html">previous version of this article</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Installation of standalone CEDET's version</h2>

<p class="first">Right now (October, 2012) there is no released version of CEDET with &quot;new&quot; activation
method, so you need to take <a href="http://www.randomsample.de/cedet-snapshots/">current snapshot</a>, or get <a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net/bzr-repo.shtml">version from repository</a>.  Unpack
source code, if this is necessary, change to directory &amp; perform following command that
will compile everything:</p>

<pre class="src">
make clean-all &amp;&amp; make
</pre>


<h2><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Customization</h2>

<p class="first">If you're using standalone CEDET's version, then you need to load it with following command:</p>

<pre class="src">
(load-file <span style="color: #008b00;">"~/emacs/cedet-bzr/cedet-devel-load.el"</span>)
</pre>

<p>But if you're using CEDET bundled with GNU Emacs, then everything will be already loaded
on start.</p>

<h3><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Semantic's customization</h3>

<p class="first">All standalone versions until release 1.1 (including) had activation method that was
different from method for CEDET bundled into GNU Emacs.  In new versions activation of
package is performed by adding of symbols for selected sub-modes into special list, and
then activating <code>semantic-mode</code>.  While in the &quot;old&quot; versions, functionality was activated
by calling one of the functions, each of them activated some specific set of features.  So
in the &quot;new&quot; version, it's enough to do following:</p>

<pre class="src">
(semantic-mode 1)
</pre>

<p>And set of enabled features will depend on what will be put into list
<code>semantic-default-submodes</code>, that can contain following symbols (it's better to populate
this list before enabling <code>semantic-mode</code>):</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>global-semanticdb-minor-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>enables global support for  Semanticdb;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-mru-bookmark-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>enables automatic bookmarking of tags that you
edited, so you can return to them later with the <code>semantic-mrub-switch-tags</code> command;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-cedet-m3-minor-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates CEDET's context menu that is bound to right mouse
button;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-highlight-func-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates highlighting of first line for current
tag (function, class, etc.);</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-stickyfunc-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates mode when name of current tag will be shown
in top line of buffer;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-decoration-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates use of separate styles for tags decoration
(depending on tag's class).  These styles are defined in the <code>semantic-decoration-styles</code>
list;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-idle-local-symbol-highlight-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates highlighting of local names
that are the same as name of tag under cursor;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates automatic parsing of source code in the
idle time;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-idle-completions-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates displaying of possible name
completions in the idle time.  Requires that <code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> was
enabled;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-idle-summary-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>activates displaying of information about current
tag in the idle time.  Requires that <code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> was enabled.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Following sub-modes are usually useful when you develop and/or debug CEDET:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows which elements weren't processed by
current parser's rules;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-show-parser-state-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows current parser state in the modeline;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>global-semantic-highlight-edits-mode</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows changes in the text that weren't processed
by incremental parser yet.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This approach allows to make Semantic's customization more flexible, as user can switch on
only necessary features.  You can also use functions with the same names to enable/disable
corresponding sub-modes for current Emacs session.  And you can also enable/disable these
modes on the per-buffer basis (usually this is done from hook): names of corresponding
variables you can find in description of <code>global-semantic-*</code> functions.</p>

<p>To enable more advanced functionality for name completion, etc., you can load the
<code>semantic/ia</code> with following command:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #00008b;">semantic/ia</span>)
</pre>

<p>After loading of this package, you'll get access to commands, described below.</p>


<h3><a name="sec6" id="sec6"></a>
System header files</h3>

<p class="first">To normal work with system-wide libraries, Semantic should has access to system include
files, that contain information about functions &amp; data types, implemented by these
libraries.</p>

<p>If you're using GCC for programming in C &amp; C++, then Semantic can automatically find
directory, where system include files are stored.  Just load <code>semantic/bovine/gcc</code> package
with following command:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #00008b;">semantic/bovine/gcc</span>)
</pre>

<p>You can also explicitly specify additional directories for searching of include files (and
these directories also could be different for specific modes).  To add some directory to
list of system include paths, you can use the <code>semantic-add-system-include</code> command &mdash; it
accepts two parameters: string with path to include files, and symbol, representing name
of major mode, for which this path will be used.  For example, to add Boost header files
for C++ mode, you need to add following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
(semantic-add-system-include <span style="color: #008b00;">"~/exp/include/boost_1_37"</span> 'c++-mode)
</pre>

<p><em>Although I want to say, that customization for Boost support is more complex, and requires
to specify where Semantic can find files with constant's definitions, etc.</em></p>


<h3><a name="sec7" id="sec7"></a>
Semantic's work optimization</h3>

<p class="first">To optimize work with tags, you can use several techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>limit search by using an EDE project, as described below;</li>
<li>explicitly specify a list of root directories for your projects, so Semantic will use
limited number of databases with syntactic information;</li>
<li>explicitly generate tags databases for often used directories (<code>/usr/include</code>,
<code>/usr/local/include</code>, etc.). You can use commands <code>semanticdb-create-ebrowse-database</code> or
<code>semanticdb-create-cscope-database</code>;</li>
<li>limit search by customization of the <code>semanticdb-find-default-throttle</code> variable for
concrete modes &mdash; for example, don't use information from system include files, by
removing <code>system</code> symbol from list of objects to search for <code>c-mode</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="src">
(setq-mode-local c-mode semanticdb-find-default-throttle
                 '(project unloaded system recursive))
</pre>

<p>Semantic extracts syntactic information when Emacs is idle.  You can customize the
<code>semantic-idle-scheduler-idle-time</code> variable to specify idle time (in seconds), if you don't
want to use default value (1 second).</p>


<h3><a name="sec8" id="sec8"></a>
Integration with imenu</h3>

<p class="first">The Semantic package can be integrated with the <em>imenu</em> package.  This lead to creation of a
menu with a list of functions, variables, and other tags.  To enable this feature you need
to add following code into your initialization file:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-semantic-hook</span> ()
  (imenu-add-to-menubar <span style="color: #008b00;">"TAGS"</span>))
(add-hook 'semantic-init-hooks 'my-semantic-hook)
</pre>


<h3><a name="sec9" id="sec9"></a>
Customization of Semanticdb</h3>

<p class="first">To enable Semanticdb you need to add the <code>global-semanticdb-minor-mode</code> symbol into the
<code>semantic-default-submodes</code> list.  And you can specify some customization variables to
control behaviour of Semanticdb &mdash; for example, where to save data, etc.  These variables
could be set via <code>semanticdb</code> customization group.</p>

<p>Semanticdb can also use databases generated by external utilities: <code>gtags</code> (from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/">GNU Global</a>), <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">exubertant ctags</a>, <code>ebrowse</code> &amp; <code>cscope</code>.  To activate this functionality you can
use following code (please, note that these commands may fail if you have no utilities
installed, or have an incorrect versions of them &mdash; that's why they a wrapped into <code>when</code>):</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #666666;">;; </span><span style="color: #666666;">if you want to enable support for gnu global
</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">when</span> (cedet-gnu-global-version-check t)
  (semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c-mode)
  (semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c++-mode))

<span style="color: #666666;">;; </span><span style="color: #666666;">enable ctags for some languages:
</span><span style="color: #666666;">;;  </span><span style="color: #666666;">Unix Shell, Perl, Pascal, Tcl, Fortran, Asm
</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">when</span> (cedet-ectag-version-check t)
  (semantic-load-enable-primary-exuberent-ctags-support))
</pre>


<h3><a name="sec10" id="sec10"></a>
EDE's customization</h3>

<p class="first">If you plan to use projects, then you need to enable corresponding mode, implemented by
the EDE package:</p>

<pre class="src">
(global-ede-mode t)
</pre>

<p>There are several types of projects supported by EDE, and I want to describe here only
some of them.</p>

<h4>Using EDE for C &amp; C++ projects</h4>

<p class="first">For correct work of Semantic with С &amp; C++ code it's recommended to use the EDE package (it
allows to work with projects, etc.).  For these languages, EDE package defines special
project type: <code>ede-cpp-root-project</code>, that provides additional information to Semantic, and
this information will be used to analyze source code of your project.</p>

<p>To define a project, you need to add following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
(ede-cpp-root-project <span style="color: #008b00;">"Test"</span>
                <span style="color: #006400;">:name</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">"Test Project"</span>
                <span style="color: #006400;">:file</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">"~/work/project/CMakeLists.txt"</span>
                <span style="color: #006400;">:include-path</span> '(<span style="color: #008b00;">"/"</span>
                                <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Common"</span>
                                <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Interfaces"</span>
                                <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Libs"</span>
                               )
                <span style="color: #006400;">:system-include-path</span> '(<span style="color: #008b00;">"~/exp/include"</span>)
                <span style="color: #006400;">:spp-table</span> '((<span style="color: #008b00;">"isUnix"</span> . <span style="color: #008b00;">""</span>)
                             (<span style="color: #008b00;">"BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK"</span> . <span style="color: #008b00;">""</span>)))
</pre>

<p>For the <code>:file</code> parameter you can use any file at root directory of your project.  This file
isn't parsed &mdash; it's used only as an anchor to search all other files in project.</p>

<p>To search include files, Semantic uses directories from two lists, that could be specified
for project.  The <code>:system-include-path</code> parameter is used to specify list of full paths
where lookup for &quot;system&quot; include files will be performed.  Another parameter &mdash;
<code>:include-path</code> specifies the list of directories, that will be used to search of &quot;local&quot;
include files (if names are starting with <code>/</code>, this means, that path is specified relative
to project's root directory).  Instead of specifying paths as lists, you can also provide
function, that will perform search of include files in your project.  You can read about
it in the EDE manual.</p>

<p>Another parameter, that could be specified in project's declaration is a list of
definitions, that will be used during code preprocessing.  The <code>:spp-table</code> parameter allows
to specify list of pairs, consisting from symbol's name &amp; value, defined for given symbol.
In our example above, we defined two symbols &mdash; 
<code>isUnix</code> and <code>BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK</code>, that will
be passed to preprocessor, and this will allow to perform proper parsing of the code.</p>

<p>User, if required, can redefine some variables for files inside project.  This could be
done by specifying the <code>:local-variables</code> parameter with value that is a list of pairs in
form symbol name/value, and these values will be set for files in project.</p>

<h5>Preprocessing of source code</h5>

<p>More information about definitions for C/C++ preprocessor you can find in documentation
for the <code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map</code> variable. You can obtain list of
preprocessor symbols, defined for file with source code, by using the
<code>semantic-lex-spp-describe</code> command.  And then use these results to set <code>:spp-table</code> parameter
or <code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map</code> variable.</p>

<p>Many libraries store all macro definitions in one or more include files, so you can use
these definitions as-is.  To do this you need to specify these files in the
<code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file</code> variable, and when CEDET will perform analysis,
then values from these files will be used.  By default, this variable has only one value
&mdash; file with definitions for C++ standard library, but you can add more data there.  As
example, I want to show CEDET's configuration for work with Qt4:</p>

<pre class="src">
(setq qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #008b00;">"/usr/include/qt4"</span>)
(semantic-add-system-include qt4-base-dir 'c++-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons qt4-base-dir 'c++-mode))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Qt/qconfig.h"</span>))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Qt/qconfig-dist.h"</span>))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #008b00;">"/Qt/qglobal.h"</span>))
</pre>

<p>After you'll add these lines to initialization file, you should be able to use names
completion for classes, defined in Qt4 library.  Example you can see on the picture below:</p>

<div id="screenshot">
<img src="../../../common/writings/emacs-devenv/cedet-qt-name-completion.png" alt="">
</div>



<h4>Using EDE for Java projects</h4>

<p class="first">Semantic includes a parser for source code written in Java, so name completion for source
code always worked, and the main problem was to get name completions for classes from JDK,
or other libraries that are used in project.  For compiled code, Semanticdb can get
information about name by using <code>javap</code> on the list libraries in the <code>CLASSPATH</code>.  To make it
working, you need to load the <code>semantic/db-javap</code> package:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #00008b;">semantic/db-javap</span>)
</pre>

<p>The path to the JDK's main library (<code>rt.jar</code> on Linux &amp; Windows, and <code>classes.jar</code> on Mac OS
X) is usually detected automatically by the <code>cedet-java-find-jdk-core-jar</code> function,
although you can change its behaviour by setting <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variables, or some
other parameters.</p>

<p>If you're using Maven to build your projects, then <code>CLASSPATH</code> will be calculating
automatically by running Maven in the root of your project (also for multi-module
projects).  And it isn't necessary to specify project's root manually &mdash; EDE will find it
automatically by searching for the <code>pom.xml</code> file.  <em>I need to mention that first call to
name completion functions could be relatively slow &mdash; EDE should run Maven and collect
information about libraries that are used in the project.  But after first run, this
information is cached, and next completions will be performed faster.</em></p>

<p>If you aren't using Maven, then you can either specify all used libraries in the
<code>semanticdb-javap-classpath</code> variable, or use the <code>ede-java-root-project</code> class, that is
similar to <code>ede-cpp-root-project</code> that was described above.  To use this type of project,
you need to add something like to you initialization file:</p>

<pre class="src">
 (ede-java-root-project <span style="color: #008b00;">"TestProject"</span>
         :file <span style="color: #008b00;">"~/work/TestProject/build.xml"</span>
         :srcroot '(<span style="color: #008b00;">"src"</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">"test"</span>)
         :localclasspath '(<span style="color: #008b00;">"/relative/path.jar"</span>)
         :classpath '(<span style="color: #008b00;">"/absolute/path.jar"</span>))
</pre>

<p>As for C/C++, you need to specify name of the project, point to existing file at the
project's root directory, and some additional options:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>:srcroot</code></strong></dt>
<dd>list of directories with source code.  Directory names are specified
relatively of project's root (in this example this is <code>src</code> &amp; <code>test</code>);</dd>
<dt><strong><code>:classpath</code></strong></dt>
<dd>list of absolute file names for used libraries;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>:localclasspath</code></strong></dt>
<dd>list of file names for used libraries, relative to project's root.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When Semantic finds such project, it can use provided information for name completion.</p>




<h2><a name="sec11" id="sec11"></a>
Work with Semantic</h2>

<p class="first">From user's point of view, Semantic provides several major features &mdash; names completions,
retrieving information about tags (variables, functions, etc.), and navigation in source
code.  Some of these features are implemented by <code>semantic/ia</code> package, while other are
implemented by Senator, and Semantic's kernel.</p>

<p>Some of commands have no standard key bindings, so it's better to select key bindings,
that are comfortable to you, and bind commands to them, like this (only for standalone
CEDET):</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-cedet-hook</span> ()
  (local-set-key [(control return)] 'semantic-ia-complete-symbol)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #008b00;">"\C-c?"</span> 'semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #008b00;">"\C-c&gt;"</span> 'semantic-complete-analyze-inline)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #008b00;">"\C-cp"</span> 'semantic-analyze-proto-impl-toggle))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-cedet-hook)
</pre>

<p><em>I want to mention, that Semantic's development is pretty active, and if something doesn't
work, or works wrong, then please, send examples of code to the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-devel">cedet-devel mailing list</a>
&mdash; the CEDET's authors usually answers pretty fast.</em></p>

<h3><a name="sec12" id="sec12"></a>
Names completion</h3>

<p class="first">Text completion for names of functions, variables &amp; classes is pretty often used feature
when you work with source code<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.  There are two packages inside Semantic that implement
this functionality &mdash; 
<code>semantic/ia</code> and Senator (it doesn't included into GNU Emacs).  <em>You
need to take into account, that in the new versions it's recommended to use Semantic only
as source of information, and perform names completion using other packages, such as
<code>auto-complete</code>.  You see example below.</em></p>

<p>Commands, implemented by <code>semantic/ia</code> use the <code>semantic-analyze-possible-completions</code>
function to create a list of all possible names completion, and this function takes into
account many parameters (plus it can be augmented by user's code to provide more precise
list of names).  At the same time, commands from Senator package use simpler methods to
create a list of all possibles completions (usually they use information only about
definitions in the current file), and this sometime lead to wrong names completion.</p>

<p>If you execute the <code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol</code> command when you're typing code, then this
will lead to completion of corresponding name &mdash; name of function, variable, or class
member, depending on the current context.  If there are several possible variants, then
this name will be completed to most common part, and if you'll call this command second
time, then buffer with all possible completions will be shown.  User can also use the
<code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu</code> command &mdash; it also performs analysis of current context,
but will display list of possible completions as a graphical menu, from which the required
name should be selected<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.  Besides this, there is <code>semantic-ia-complete-tip</code> command, that
displays list of possible completions as tooltip.</p>

<p>As was mentioned above, the Senator package, also provides commands for names completion.
It work very fast, but with less precision (as they use few parameters during computation
of variants for completions). The <code>senator-complete-symbol</code> command (<code>C-c , TAB</code>) completes
name for current tag, and insert first found completion as result.  If it inserts wrong
name, then you can insert second name from completion list by repeating this command, and
so on.  If there are a lot of the possible variants, or you want to see full list of
functions and variables for some class, then it's better to use the
<code>senator-completion-menu-popup</code> command (<code>C-c , SPC</code>) &mdash; it displays list of all possible
completions as a graphical menu.</p>

<p>Besides these commands, user can use special mode (only for some languages) &mdash;
<code>semantic-idle-completions-mode</code> (or enable it globally by adding
<code>global-semantic-idle-completions-mode</code> symbol into <code>semantic-default-submodes</code> list) &mdash; in
this mode names completions are shown automatically if user stops its work for a some time
(idle time).  By default, only first possible completion is shown, and user can use the
<code>TAB</code> key to navigate through list of possible completions.</p>

<p>For C-like languages, user can use the <code>semantic-complete-self-insert</code> command, bound to the
<code>.</code> and/or <code>&gt;</code> keys, as this shown below:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-c-mode-cedet-hook</span> ()
 (local-set-key <span style="color: #008b00;">"."</span> 'semantic-complete-self-insert)
 (local-set-key <span style="color: #008b00;">"&gt;"</span> 'semantic-complete-self-insert))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-cedet-hook)
</pre>

<p>Evaluation of this code will lead to execution of the <code>semantic-complete-self-insert</code>
command when user will press <code>.</code> or <code>&gt;</code> after variables, that are instances of some data
structure, and displaying a list of possible completions for given class or structure.</p>

<p>If you're programming in C &amp; C++, then you can also get name completions using information
from Clang (versions 2.9 &amp; above).  To do this, you need to load the <code>semantic/bovine/clang</code>
package, and call the <code>semantic-clang-activate</code> function.  After that, Semantic will start
to call Clang, and use its code analyzer to calculate list of possible names completions.</p>

<h4>Names completion with  auto-complete package</h4>

<p class="first">The <a href="http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/">auto-complete</a> package was developed to automatically complete text using information
from different sources: predefined dictionaries, text from current buffer, external
programs (GNU Global, etags, ...), etc.  Semantic could be also used as source of
information.</p>

<p>This package is available in the GNU Emacs's package repository (execute <code>M-x
package-list-packages</code> to get list of available packages), but you can also install it via
<code>el-get</code> or manually.  Installation &amp; customization are described in <a href="http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/manual.html">user's manual</a>, so I
won't cover these parts.</p>

<p>To use information from Semantic for names completion, you need to add <code>ac-source-semantic</code>
or <code>ac-source-semantic-raw</code> into <code>ac-sources</code> list (this list allows you to control which data
sources will be used for current buffer, so you can change it as you want).
<code>ac-source-semantic-raw</code> differs from <code>ac-source-semantic</code> that for it the filtering of
information isn't performed.</p>

<p>So your setup can be performed following way &mdash; instead of bounding keys for
<code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu</code>, <code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol</code> &amp; other functions, you can
simply add new names completion sources, and after that use <code>auto-complete</code> bindings to get
names completion:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-c-mode-cedet-hook</span> ()
  (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-gtags)
  (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-semantic))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-cedet-hook)
</pre>



<h3><a name="sec13" id="sec13"></a>
Getting information about tags</h3>

<p class="first">The <code>semantic/ia</code> package provides several commands, that allow to get information about
classes, functions &amp; variables (including documentation from Doxygen-style comments).
Currently following commands are implemented:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-show-doc</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows documentation for function or variable, whose names is
under point.  Documentation is shown in separate buffer.  For variables this command
shows their declaration, including type of variable, and documentation string (if it's
available).  For functions, prototype of the function is shown, including documentation
for arguments and returning value (if comments are available);</dd>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-show-summary</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows documentation for name under point, but information is
shown in the mini-buffer, so user will see only variable's declaration or function's
prototype;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-describe-class</code></strong></dt>
<dd>asks user for a name of the class, and return list of
functions &amp; variables, defined in given class, plus all its parent classes.</dd>
</dl>


<h3><a name="sec14" id="sec14"></a>
Navigation in source code</h3>

<p class="first">One of the most useful commands for navigation in source code is the <code>semantic-ia-fast-jump</code>
command, that allows to jump to declaration of variable or function, whose name is under
point.  You can return back by using the <code>semantic-mrub-switch-tag</code> command (<code>C-x B</code>), that is
available when you enable the <code>semantic-mru-bookmark-mode</code> minor mode.</p>

<p>Semantic also provides two additional commands for jumping to function or variable:
defined in current file &mdash; 
<code>semantic-complete-jump-local</code> (<code>C-c , j</code>), or defined in current
project &mdash; 
<code>semantic-complete-jump</code> (<code>C-c , J</code>).  Both commands allow to enter name of
function or variable (including local variables inside functions) and jump to given
definition (you can use name completion when entering the name).</p>

<p>The main difference between <code>semantic-ia-fast-jump</code> &amp; <code>semantic-complete-jump</code> commands is
that the first properly handles complex names, like <code>this::that-&gt;foo()</code>, while the second,
can find only simple names, like <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>semantic-analyze-proto-impl-toggle</code> command allows to switch between function's
declaration and its implementation in languages, that allow to have separate declaration
and implementation of functions.  Another useful command is
<code>semantic-decoration-include-visit</code>, that allows to jump to include file, whose name is
under cursor.</p>

<p>Senator provides several commands for navigation in source code.  This is <code>senator-next-tag</code>
(<code>C-c , n</code>) and <code>senator-previous-tag</code> (<code>C-c , p</code>) commands, that move cursor to next or
previous tag.  There is also the <code>senator-go-to-up-reference</code> command (<code>C-c , u</code>), that moves
cursor to the &quot;parent&quot; tag (for example, for class member function, &quot;parent&quot; tag is class
declaration).</p>


<h3><a name="sec15" id="sec15"></a>
Search for places where function is called</h3>

<p class="first">Semantic also has very useful command &mdash; 
<code>semantic-symref</code>, that allows to find places,
where symbol (whose name is under point) is used in your project.  If you want to find use
of symbol with arbitrary name, then you can use the <code>semantic-symref-symbol</code> command, that
allows to enter name of the symbol to lookup.</p>

<p>If references to given name weren't found in corresponding database (GNU Global, etc.),
then these commands will try to find them using the <code>find-grep</code> command.  As result of execution
of these commands, a new buffer with results will be created, and user can jump to found
places:</p>

<div id="screenshot">
<img src="../../../common/writings/emacs-devenv/cedet-symref.png" alt="">
</div>


<h3><a name="sec16" id="sec16"></a>
Source code folding</h3>

<p class="first">As Semantic has almost complete syntactic information about source code, this allows it to
implement folding functionality, similar to functionality implemented by <em>hideshow</em> package.
To enable this feature, you need to perform customization of the
<code>global-semantic-tag-folding-mode</code> variable.  When you'll enable it, this will lead to
displaying of small triangles at the <em>fringle</em> field, and you will able to fold and unfold
pieces of code by clicking on them (this should work not only for source code, but also
for comments, and other objects).</p>

<p>Senator also has similar functionality, but it's usually used for top-level objects &mdash;
functions, class declarations, etc.  You can fold piece of code with the <code>senator-fold-tag</code>
command (<code>C-c , -</code>), and unfold it with <code>senator-unfold-tag</code> (<code>C-c , +</code>).</p>


<h3><a name="sec17" id="sec17"></a>
More Senator's commands</h3>

<p class="first">The Senator package provides number of commands for work with tags, that allow user to cut
or copy tag, and insert it in another place.  To cut current tag (usually this is
declaration of some function, or its implementation) the <code>senator-kill-tag</code> command (<code>C-c ,
C-w</code>) should be used.  You can insert complete tag with standard key binding <code>C-y</code>, while the
<code>senator-yank-tag</code> command (<code>C-c , C-y</code>) inserts only tag declaration, without body. Another
useful command is <code>senator-copy-tag</code> (<code>C-c , M-w</code>), that copies current tag &mdash; this is very
handy when, for example, you want to insert declaration of function into include file.</p>

<p>Senator allows to change behaviour of standard search commands (<code>re-search-forward</code>,
<code>isearch-forward</code> and other), when you work with source code, such way, so they will perform
search only in the given tags.  To enable this mode you can use the
<code>senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode</code> command(<code>C-c , i</code>), and with the
<code>senator-search-set-tag-class-filter</code> command (<code>C-c , f</code>) you can limit search to given tag
types &mdash; 
<code>function</code> for functions, <code>variable</code> for variables, etc.</p>

<p>You can also perform tags search without enabling this mode &mdash; you just need to call
corresponding command: <code>senator-search-forward</code> or <code>senator-search-backward</code>.</p>



<h2><a name="sec18" id="sec18"></a>
Work with Srecode</h2>

<p class="first">The Srecode package allows user to define code templates, but it differs from other
packages, that provide insertion of templates, because list of available templates can
vary depending on the current context.  For example, insertion of <code>get/set</code> functions should
happen only when you inside class declaration.  Or, insertion of function's declaration,
may happen only outside of other function.</p>

<p>The main command, that is used to insert templates, is the <code>srecode-insert</code>, that is bound
to the <code>C-c / /</code> keys.  This command will ask user for template's name (you can enter it
using name completion).  List of available templates will vary, depending on the current
context.  If you want to insert the same template once again, then you can use the
<code>srecode-insert-again</code> command (<code>C-c / .</code>).</p>

<p>Templates that are defined by user, can also use they own key bindings.  They can use
lower-case symbols from range <code>C-c / [a..z]</code>, and user can specify in template's definition,
which key will be assigned to it.  For example, for C++ you can use the <code>C-c / c</code> key
binding to insert class declaration.</p>

<p>Key bindings, that use upper-case symbols, are reserved for templates &amp; commands defined
in Srecode.  For example, <code>C-c / G</code> (<code>srecode-insert-getset</code>) inserts pair of functions
<code>get/set</code> for some class member variable, while <code>C-c / E</code> (<code>srecode-edit</code>) is used to edit
templates.  List of these commands isn't constant, so you need to look into documentation
to find actual list of commands.</p>

<p>Besides templates, supplied with CEDET, user can define their own templates, and store
them in the <code>~/.srecode</code> directory, where CEDET will find them automatically.  You can read
about template's creation in the Srecode manual, that comes together with other
documentation in the CEDET distribution.</p>


<h2><a name="sec19" id="sec19"></a>
Additional packages</h2>

<p class="first">Together with CEDET the number of additional packages is supplied.  Some of them are
located in the <code>contrib</code> subdirectory, that you need to add to library search list.</p>

<h3><a name="sec20" id="sec20"></a>
The eassist package</h3>

<p class="first">The <em>eassist</em> package provides several commands, that use information obtained from
Semantic.  By default, these commands have no predefined key bindings, so you need to
select them yourself.</p>

<p>The <code>eassist-list-methods</code> command, executed in the file with source code, will show you a
list of functions, defined in current buffer, and will allow you to perform quick jump to
selected function.</p>

<p>If you develop code in C and/or C++ languages, then the <code>eassist-switch-h-cpp</code> command,
could be very useful to you &mdash; it jumps between header file and file, that contains
implementation (if they have same names, but different extensions).</p>
