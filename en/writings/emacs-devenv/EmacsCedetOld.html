<p>This article doesn't pretend to be detailed description of how customize Emacs to be
complete development environment (this is topic for <a href="index.html">separate article</a>).  I just tried to
provide a small description of &quot;How to customize <a href="http://cedet.sf.net">CEDET</a> to work with C &amp; C++&quot;, although
most of this description will be also applicable for other languages, supported by CEDET.</p>

<p>Please, take into account, that this article describes standalone versions of CEDET up to
version 1.1.  After that release, many changes were made, and most important are related
to changing of directory's structure &amp; using the same activation method as CEDET in GNU
Emacs. I plan to update this article soon, but in the meantime you can use
<a href="https://github.com/alexott/emacs-configs/blob/master/rc/emacs-rc-cedet.el">my actual config file</a> that I use together with fresh CEDET version.</p>

<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1"></a>
What is CEDET?</h2>

<p class="first">The CEDET package is a collection libraries, implementing different commands, but used for
one goal &mdash; provide functionality for work with source code written in different
programming languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Semantic</em> is a base for construction of syntactic analyzers for different programming
languages. It allows to provide common representation for information extracted from
code.  Using this information, CEDET &amp; other packages, such as <a href="http://jdee.sourceforge.net/">JDEE</a> and <a href="http://ecb.sf.net">ECB</a>, can
implement functionality, required for modern development environment (something like
Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.);</li>
<li><em>SemanticDB</em> is included into Semantic, and implements interfaces to different storage
modules, that keep information, needed for names completion, source code navigation,
and so on.  Syntactic information could be saved between Emacs sessions, so it reduce
need for re-parsing of source code that wasn't modified;</li>
<li><em>Senator</em> implements navigation in source code, using information, extracted by Semantic;</li>
<li><em>Srecode</em> &mdash; package for source code generation, using syntactic information (including
information, extracted by Semantic);</li>
<li><em>EDE</em> implements set of extensions to work with projects &mdash; user can control list of the
targets to build, build the project, etc.  Besides this, using the notion of the
project, you can have more precise control about Semantic's operations &mdash; name
completions, navigation, and so on;</li>
<li><em>Speedbar</em> is used to display information about current buffer using different sources of
information &mdash; Semantic, some specialized information providers (for texinfo &amp; html,
for example).</li>
<li><em>Eieio</em> &mdash; library, that implements CLOS-like (Common Lisp Object System) infrastructure
for Emacs Lisp;</li>
<li><em>Cogre</em> is a library for drawing of UML-like diagrams in Emacs buffer, with basic
integration with Semantic.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
Installation of the CEDET</h2>

<p class="first">Currently it's better to use development version of the CEDET, that is available from
repository at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cedet/develop">Sourceforge.net</a>.  After downloading of code, you need to change to cedet
directory and compile the package with following command:</p>

<pre class="src">
emacs -Q -l cedet-build.el -f cedet-build
</pre>

<p>or, to compile in terminal window, and exit after compilation, you can use following
command:</p>

<pre class="src">
emacs -Q -nw -l cedet-build.el -f cedet-build -f save-buffers-kill-terminal
</pre>


<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Customization</h2>

<p class="first">The loading of package is performed by <code>cedet.el</code> script, so all you need to do &mdash; just add
following line to the your Emacs initialization file<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre class="src">
(load-file <span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/emacs/cedet/common/cedet.el"</span>)
</pre>

<p>If you plan to use EDE projects, then you need to switch on corresponding mode &mdash; it's
implemented by EDE package:</p>

<pre class="src">
(global-ede-mode t)
</pre>

<h3><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Semantic's customization</h3>

<p class="first">Depending on your requirements, you can use one of commands, described below, to load
corresponding set of features (these commands are listed in increasing order, and each
command include features from previous commands):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>semantic-load-enable-minimum-features</code> &mdash; enables only minimum of necessary features &mdash;
keep syntactic information for current buffer up-to date, storing of syntactic
information for later use (Semanticdb), and loading of syntactic information with
Semanticdb and Ebrowse;</li>
<li><code>semantic-load-enable-code-helpers</code> &mdash; enables <code>senator-minor-mode</code> for navigation in
buffer, <code>semantic-mru-bookmark-mode</code> for storing positions of visited tags, and
<code>semantic-idle-summary-mode</code>, that shows information about tag under point when Emacs is
idle;</li>
<li><code>semantic-load-enable-gaudy-code-helpers</code> &mdash; enables <code>semantic-stickyfunc-name</code> that
displays name of current function in topmost line of buffer, <code>semantic-decoration-mode</code>
to decorate tags, using different styles, and <code>semantic-idle-completion-mode</code> for
automatic generation of possible names completions, if user stops his work for some
time;</li>
<li><code>semantic-load-enable-excessive-code-helpers</code> &mdash; enables <code>which-func-mode</code>, that shows name
of current function in status line;</li>
<li><code>semantic-load-enable-semantic-debugging-helpers</code> &mdash; enables several modes, that are
useful when you debugging Semantic &mdash; to show parsing errors, Semantic's state, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, you need to add call to one of these commands right after command, that performs
loading of CEDET.  For example:</p>

<pre class="src">
(semantic-load-enable-excessive-code-helpers)
</pre>

<p>The rest of this section assumes that the minimal Semantic features have been loaded.</p>

<p>To use additional features for names completion, and displaying of information for tags &amp;
classes, you also need to load the <code>semantic-ia</code> package.  This could be done with following
command:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">semantic-ia</span>)
</pre>

<p>After loading of this package, you'll get access to commands, described below.</p>

<h4>System header files</h4>

<p class="first">To normal work with system-wide libraries, Semantic should has access to system include
files, that contain information about functions &amp; data types, implemented by these
libraries.</p>

<p>If you're using GCC for programming in C &amp; C++, then Semantic can automatically find path,
where system include files are stored.  To do this, you need to load <code>semantic-gcc</code> package
with following command:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">semantic-gcc</span>)
</pre>

<p>You can also explicitly specify additional paths for look up of include files (and these
paths also could be different for specific modes).  To add some path to list of system
include paths, you can use the <code>semantic-add-system-include</code> command, that accepts two
parameters &mdash; string with path to include files, and symbol, representing name of major
mode, for which this path will used.  For example, to add Boost header files for C++ mode,
you need to add following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
(semantic-add-system-include <span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/exp/include/boost_1_37"</span> 'c++-mode)
</pre>


<h4>Optimization of Semantic's work</h4>

<p class="first">To optimize work with tags, you can use several techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>limit search by using an EDE project, as described below;</li>
<li>explicitly specify a list of root directories for your projects, so Semantic will use
limited number of databases with syntactic information;</li>
<li>explicitly generate tags databases for often used directories (<code>/usr/include</code>,
<code>/usr/local/include</code>, etc.) using commands <code>semanticdb-create-ebrowse-database</code> or
<code>semanticdb-create-cscope-database</code>;</li>
<li>limit search by customization of the <code>semanticdb-find-default-throttle</code> variable for
concrete modes &mdash; for example, don't use information from system include files, by
removing <code>system</code> symbol from list of objects to search for <code>c-mode</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="src">
(setq-mode-local c-mode semanticdb-find-default-throttle
                 '(project unloaded system recursive))
</pre>

<p>Semantic extracts syntactic information when Emacs is idle.  You can customize the
<code>semantic-idle-scheduler-idle-time</code> variable to specify idle time (in seconds), if you don't
want to use default value (2 seconds).</p>


<h4>Integration with imenu</h4>

<p class="first">The Semantic package can be integrated with the <em>imenu</em> package.  This lead to creation of a
menu with a list of functions, variables, and other tags.  To enable this feature you can
either use <code>semantic-load-enable-code-helpers</code>, or you need to add following code into your
initialization file:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-semantic-hook</span> ()
  (imenu-add-to-menubar <span style="color: #8b2252;">"TAGS"</span>))
(add-hook 'semantic-init-hooks 'my-semantic-hook)
</pre>



<h3><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Customization of Semanticdb</h3>

<p class="first">If you're using standard procedure for loading of CEDET, then Semanticdb will be loaded
automatically.  Otherwise, you can load and enable it with following commands:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">semanticdb</span>)
(global-semanticdb-minor-mode 1)
</pre>

<p>To customize Semanticdb you need to specify number of variables, that are used to specify
path, where databases will be stored, and some other parameters.  These variables could be
set via <code>semanticdb</code> customization group.</p>

<p>Besides this, Semanticdb can use databases generated by external utilities &mdash; 
<code>gtags</code> from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/">GNU Global</a>, <code>ctags</code>, <code>ebrowse</code> &amp; <code>cscope</code>.  To activate this you can use following code (please,
note that these commands will fail if you have no utilities installed, or have an
incorrect versions of them &mdash; that's why they a wrapped into <code>when</code>):</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #7f7f7f;">;; </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">if you want to enable support for gnu global
</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">when</span> (cedet-gnu-global-version-check t)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">semanticdb-global</span>)
  (semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c-mode)
  (semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c++-mode))

<span style="color: #7f7f7f;">;; </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">enable ctags for some languages:
</span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">;;  </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">Unix Shell, Perl, Pascal, Tcl, Fortran, Asm
</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">when</span> (cedet-ectag-version-check)
  (semantic-load-enable-primary-exuberent-ctags-support))
</pre>


<h3><a name="sec6" id="sec6"></a>
How to customize  Semantic to work with C &amp; C++ projects</h3>

<p class="first">For correct work of Semantic with С &amp; C++ code it's recommended to use the EDE package (it
allows to work with projects, etc.).  For these languages, EDE package defines special
project type: <code>ede-cpp-root-project</code>, that provides additional information to Semantic, and
this information will be used to analyze source code of your project.</p>

<p>To define a project, you need to add following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
(ede-cpp-root-project <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Test"</span>
                <span style="color: #483d8b;">:name</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Test Project"</span>
                <span style="color: #483d8b;">:file</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/work/project/CMakeLists.txt"</span>
                <span style="color: #483d8b;">:include-path</span> '(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"/"</span>
                                <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Common"</span>
                                <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Interfaces"</span>
                                <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Libs"</span>
                               )
                <span style="color: #483d8b;">:system-include-path</span> '(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"~/exp/include"</span>)
                <span style="color: #483d8b;">:spp-table</span> '((<span style="color: #8b2252;">"isUnix"</span> . <span style="color: #8b2252;">""</span>)
                             (<span style="color: #8b2252;">"BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK"</span> . <span style="color: #8b2252;">""</span>)))
</pre>

<p>For the <code>:file</code> parameter you can use any file at root directory of your project.  This file
isn't parsed &mdash; it's used only as an anchor to search all other files in project.</p>

<p>To search include files, Semantic uses directories from two lists, that could be specified
for project.  The <code>:system-include-path</code> parameter is used to specify list of full paths
where lookup for &quot;system&quot; include files will be performed.  Another parameter &mdash;
<code>:include-path</code> specifies the list of directories, relative to the project's root directory,
that will used to search of &quot;local&quot; include files (if names are starting with <code>/</code>, this
means, that path is specified relative to project's root directory).  Instead of
specifying paths as lists, you can also provide function, that will perform search of
include files in your project.  You can read about it in the EDE manual.</p>

<p>Another parameter, that could be specified in project's declaration is a list of
definitions, that will be used during code preprocessing.  The <code>:spp-table</code> parameter allows
to specify list of pairs, consisting from symbol's name &amp; value, defined for given symbol.
In our example above, we defined two symbols &mdash; 
<code>isUnix</code> and <code>BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK</code>, that will
be passed to preprocessor, and this will allow to perform proper parsing of the code.</p>

<p>User, if this is needed, can redefine some variables for files inside project.  This could
be done by specifying the <code>:local-variables</code> parameter with value consisting of list of
pairs in form symbol name/value, and these values will be set for files in project.</p>


<h3><a name="sec7" id="sec7"></a>
Preprocessing of source code</h3>

<p class="first">More information about definitions for C/C++ preprocessor you can find in documentation
for the <code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map</code> variable. You can obtain list of
preprocessor symbols, defined for file with source code, using the
<code>semantic-lex-spp-describe</code> command.  And then use these results to set <code>:spp-table</code> parameter
or <code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map</code> variable.</p>

<p>Many libraries store all macro definitions in one or more include files, so you can use
these definitions as-is.  To do this you need to list these files in the
<code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file</code> variable, and when CEDET will perform analysis,
then values from these files will be used.  By default, this variable has only one value
&mdash; file with definitions for C++ standard library, but you can add more data there.  As
example, I want to show CEDET's configuration for work with Qt4:</p>

<pre class="src">
(setq qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/usr/include/qt4"</span>)
(semantic-add-system-include qt4-base-dir 'c++-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons qt4-base-dir 'c++-mode))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Qt/qconfig.h"</span>))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Qt/qconfig-dist.h"</span>))
(add-to-list 'semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file (concat qt4-base-dir <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/Qt/qglobal.h"</span>))
</pre>

<p>After you'll add these lines to initialization file, you should be able to use name
completion for classes, defined in Qt4 library.  Example you can see on the picture below:</p>

<div id="screenshot">
<img src="../../../common/writings/emacs-devenv/cedet-qt-name-completion.png" alt="">
</div>



<h2><a name="sec8" id="sec8"></a>
Work with Semantic</h2>

<p class="first">From the user's point of view, Semantic implements several major functions &mdash; name
completions, retrieving information about tags (variables, functions, etc.), and
navigation in source code.  Some of these functions are implemented by <code>semantic-ia</code>
package, while other are implemented by Senator, and Semantic's kernel.</p>

<p>Some of commands have no standard key bindings, so it's better to select key bindings,
that are comfortable to you, and bind commands to them, like this:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-cedet-hook</span> ()
  (local-set-key [(control return)] 'semantic-ia-complete-symbol)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\C-c?"</span> 'semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\C-c&gt;"</span> 'semantic-complete-analyze-inline)
  (local-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\C-cp"</span> 'semantic-analyze-proto-impl-toggle))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-cedet-hook)
</pre>

<p><em>I want to mention, that Semantic's development is pretty active, and if something doesn't
work, or works wrong, then please, send examples of code to the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-devel">cedet-devel mailing list</a>
&mdash; the CEDET's authors usually answers pretty fast.</em></p>

<h3><a name="sec9" id="sec9"></a>
Names completion</h3>

<p class="first">Text completion for names of functions, variables &amp; classes is pretty often used feature
when you work with source code<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.  There are two packages inside Semantic that implement
this functionality &mdash; 
<code>semantic-ia</code> and Senator.  Commands, implemented by <code>semantic-ia</code> use
the <code>semantic-analyze-possible-completions</code> function to create a list of all possible names
completion, and this function takes into account many parameters (plus it can be augmented
by user's code to provide more precise list of names).  At the same time, commands from
Senator package use simpler methods to create a list of all possibles completions (usually
they use information only about definitions in the current file), and this sometime lead
to the wrong completion of names.</p>

<p>If you execute the <code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol</code> command when you typing code, then this
will lead to completion of corresponding name &mdash; name of function, variable, or class
member, depending on the current context.  If there are several possible variants, then
this name will be completed to most common part, and if you'll call this command second
time, then buffer with all possible completions will be shown.  User can also use the
<code>semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu</code> command &mdash; it also performs analysis of current context,
but will display list of possible completions as a graphical menu, from which the needed
name should be selected<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.  Besides this, there is <code>semantic-ia-complete-tip</code> command, that
displays list of possible completions as tooltip.</p>

<p>As was mentioned above, the Senator package, also provides commands for names completion,
that work fast, but with less precision (as they use few parameters during computation of
variants for completions). The <code>senator-complete-symbol</code> command (<code>C-c , TAB</code>) completes name
for current tag, and insert first found completion as result.  If it inserts wrong name,
then you can insert second name from completion list by repeating this command, and so on.
If there are a lot of the possible variants, or you want to see full list of functions and
variables for some class, then it's better to use the <code>senator-completion-menu-popup</code>
command (<code>C-c , SPC</code>), that displays list of all possible completions as a graphical menu.</p>

<p>Besides these commands, user can use special mode (only for some languages) &mdash;
<code>semantic-idle-completions-mode</code> (it's loaded when you use the
<code>emantic-load-enable-gaudy-code-helpers</code> command, or you can enable it explicitly) &mdash; in
this mode names completions are shown automatically if user stops its work for a some time
(idle time).  By default, only first possible completion is shown, and user can use the
<code>TAB</code> key to navigate through list of possible completions.</p>

<p>For C-like languages, user can use the <code>semantic-complete-self-insert</code> command, bound to the
<code>.</code> and/or <code>&gt;</code> keys, as this show below:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">my-c-mode-cedet-hook</span> ()
 (local-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"."</span> 'semantic-complete-self-insert)
 (local-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"&gt;"</span> 'semantic-complete-self-insert))

</pre>

<p>Evaluation of this code will lead to execution of the <code>semantic-complete-self-insert</code>
command when user will press <code>.</code> or <code>&gt;</code> after variables, that are instances of some class or
structure, and displaying of list of possible completions for given class or structure.</p>

Getting information about tags</h3>

<p class="first">The <code>semantic-ia</code> package provides several commands, that allow to get information about
classes, functions &amp; variables (including documentation from Doxygen-style comments).
Currently following commands are implemented:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-show-doc</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows documentation for function or variable, whose names is
under point.  Documentation is shown in separate buffer.  For variables this command
shows their declaration, including type of variable, and documentation string, if it's
available.  For functions, prototype of the function is shown, including documentation
for arguments and returning value (if comments are available);</dd>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-show-summary</code></strong></dt>
<dd>shows documentation for name under point, but information is
shown in the mini-buffer, so user will see only variable's declaration or function's
prototype;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>semantic-ia-describe-class</code></strong></dt>
<dd>asks user for a name of the class, and return list of
functions &amp; variables, defined in given class, plus all its parent classes.</dd>
</dl>


<h3><a name="sec11" id="sec11"></a>
Navigation in source code</h3>

<p class="first">One of the most useful commands for navigation in the source code is the
<code>semantic-ia-fast-jump</code> command, that allows to jump to declaration of variable or function,
whose name is under point.  You can return back by using the <code>semantic-mrub-switch-tag</code>
command (<code>C-x B</code>), that is available when you enable the <code>semantic-mru-bookmark-mode</code> minor
mode.</p>

<p>Semantic also provides two additional commands for jumping to function or variable:
defined in current file &mdash; 
<code>semantic-complete-jump-local</code> (<code>C-c , j</code>), or defined in current
project &mdash; 
<code>semantic-complete-jump</code> (<code>C-c , J</code>).  Both commands allow to enter name of
function or variable (including local variables for functions) and jump to given
definition (you can use name completion when entering the name).</p>

<p>The main difference between <code>semantic-ia-fast-jump</code> &amp; <code>semantic-complete-jump</code> commands is
that the first properly handles complex names, like <code>this::that-&gt;foo()</code>, while the second,
can find only simple names, like <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>semantic-analyze-proto-impl-toggle</code> command allows to switch between function's
declaration and its implementation in languages, that allow to have separate declaration
and implementation of functions.  Another useful command is
<code>semantic-decoration-include-visit</code>, that allows to jump to include file, whose name is
under cursor.</p>

<p>Senator provides several commands for navigation in source code.  This is <code>senator-next-tag</code>
(<code>C-c , n</code>) and <code>senator-previous-tag</code> (<code>C-c , p</code>) commands, that move cursor to next or
previous tag.  There is also the <code>senator-go-to-up-reference</code> command (<code>C-c , u</code>), that move
cursor to the &quot;parent&quot; tag (for example, for class member function, &quot;parent&quot; tag is class
declaration).</p>


<h3><a name="sec12" id="sec12"></a>
Search for places where function is called</h3>

<p class="first">Not so long ago a very useful command was implemented in Semantic &mdash; 
<code>semantic-symref</code>, that
allows to find places, where symbol, whose name is under point, is used in your project.
If you want to find use of symbol with arbitrary name, then you can use the
<code>semantic-symref-symbol</code> command, that allows to enter name of the symbol to lookup.</p>

<p>If references to given name weren't found in corresponding database (GNU Global, etc.),
then these commands try to find them using the <code>find-grep</code> command.  As result of execution
of these commands, a new buffer with results will be created, and user can jump to found
places:</p>

<h3><a name="sec13" id="sec13"></a>
Source code folding</h3>

<p class="first">As Semantic has almost complete syntactic information about source code, this allows it to
implement folding functionality, similar to functionality implemented by <em>hideshow</em> package.
To enable this feature, you need to perform customization of the
<code>global-semantic-tag-folding-mode</code> variable.  When you'll enable it, this will lead to
displaying of small triangles at the <em>fringle</em> field, and you will able to fold and unfold
pieces of code pressing on them (this should work not only for source code, but also
for comments, and other objects).</p>

<p>Senator also has similar functionality, but it usually used for top-level objects &mdash;
functions, class declarations, etc.  You can fold piece of code with the <code>senator-fold-tag</code>
command (<code>C-c , -</code>), and unfold it with <code>senator-unfold-tag</code> (<code>C-c , +</code>).</p>


<h3><a name="sec14" id="sec14"></a>
More Senator's commands</h3>

<p class="first">The Senator package provides number of commands for work with tags, that allow user to cut
or copy tag, and insert it in another place.  To cut current tag (usually this is
declaration of some function, or its implementation) the <code>senator-kill-tag</code> command (<code>C-c ,
C-w</code>) should be used.  You can insert complete tag with standard key binding <code>C-y</code>, while the
<code>senator-yank-tag</code> command (<code>C-c , C-y</code>) inserts only tag declaration, without body. Another
useful command is <code>senator-copy-tag</code> (<code>C-c , M-w</code>), that copies current tag &mdash; this is very
handy when you want to insert declaration of function into include file, for example.</p>

<p>Senator allows to change behaviour of standard search commands (<code>re-search-forward</code>,
<code>isearch-forward</code> and other), when you work with source code, such way, so they will perform
search only in the given tags.  To enable this mode you can use the
<code>senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode</code> command(<code>C-c , i</code>), and with the
<code>senator-search-set-tag-class-filter</code> command (<code>C-c , f</code>) you can limit search to given tag
types &mdash; 
<code>function</code> for functions, <code>variable</code> for variables, etc.</p>

<p>You can also perform tags search without enabling this mode &mdash; you just need to call
corresponding command: <code>senator-search-forward</code> or <code>senator-search-backward</code>.</p>



<h2><a name="sec15" id="sec15"></a>
Work with Srecode</h2>

<p class="first">The Srecode package allows user to define code templates, but it differs from other
packages, that provide insertion of templates, as list of available templates can vary
depending on the current context.  For example, insertion of <code>get/set</code> functions should
happen only when you inside class declaration.  Or, insertion of function declaration,
could happen only outside of other function.</p>

<p>The main command, that is used to insert templates, is the <code>srecode-insert</code>, that is bound
to the <code>C-c / /</code> keys.  This command will ask user for template's name (you can enter it
using name completion).  List of available templates will vary, depending on the current
context.  If you want to insert the same template once again, then you can use the
<code>srecode-insert-again</code> command (<code>C-c / .</code>).</p>

<p>Templates, defined by user, could also use they own key bindings.  They can use lower-case
symbols from range <code>C-c / [a..z]</code>, and user can specify in template's definition, which key
will be assigned to it.  For example, for C++ you can use the <code>C-c / c</code> key binding to
insert class declaration.</p>

<p>Key bindings, that use upper-case symbols, are reserved for templates &amp; commands defined
in Srecode.  For example, <code>C-c / G</code> (<code>srecode-insert-getset</code>) inserts pair of functions
<code>get/set</code> for some class member variable, while <code>C-c / E</code> (<code>srecode-edit</code>) is used to edit
templates.  List of these commands isn't constant, so you need to look into documentation
to find actual list of commands.</p>

<p>Besides templates, supplied with CEDET, user can define their own templates, and store
them in the <code>~/.srecode</code> directory, where CEDET finds them automatically.  You can read
about template's creation in the Srecode manual, that comes together with other
documentation in the CEDET distribution.</p>


<h2><a name="sec16" id="sec16"></a>
Additional packages</h2>

<p class="first">Together with CEDET the number of additional packages is supplied.  Some of them are
located in the <code>contrib</code> subdirectory, that is also added to library search list, when you
load CEDET, so you don't need to do anything special to load them.</p>

<h3><a name="sec17" id="sec17"></a>
The eassist package</h3>

<p class="first">The <em>eassist</em> package provides several commands, that use information obtained from
Semantic.  By default, these commands have no predefined key bindings, so you need to
select them yourself.</p>

<p>The <code>eassist-list-methods</code> command, executed in the file with source code, will show you a
list of functions, defined in current buffer, and will allow you to perform quick jump to
selected function.</p>

<p>If you develop code in C and/or C++ languages, then the <code>eassist-switch-h-cpp</code> command,
could be very useful to you &mdash; it jumps between header file and file, that contains
implementation (if they have same names, but different extensions).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a class="footnum" name="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3.</a> There is also <code>semantic-complete-analyze-inline</code> command, that shows list of all
