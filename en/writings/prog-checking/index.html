    <h1>Finding memory leaks and other bugs in programs</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<p>As software becomes more complex, are increasing number of issues related to work with
memory &mdash; memory leaks, writing behind boundaries of memory blocks, etc.  I tried to
describe some tools and libraries, that could be useful for finding and fixing such bugs.</p>

<p>This article is written mostly for programmers, who are working on Unix-like operating
systems (but some of tools also could work under MS Windows).  Some of described tools can
work on several OSes, and different processors, but others could work only on specific
combinations of hardware and OSes.</p>

<p>Tools, described in this article, are used to perform analysis of existing programs, and
their principles of work based on analysis of executed code.  I need to mention, that also
exists tools for performing statical analysis of source code, but this is theme for other
article. In this article will described following tools &amp; libraries:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a href="Valgrind.html">Valgrind</a></strong></dt>
<dd>very powerful tool, that not only helps in finding of memory leaks, but also
allow to find synchronisation errors in multi-threading programs, and analyse performance
of programs</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="GooglePT.html">Google Performance Tools</a></strong></dt>
<dd>toolkit, that contain utilities, that allow to perform
program performance profiling, analyse memory consumption, and find memory leaks</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="Exmap.html">Exmap</a></strong></dt>
<dd>special utility for Linux, that allow to collect information about program's
real memory consumption</dd>

<dt><strong><a href="DMalloc.html">dmalloc</a></strong></dt>
<dd>library for find errors of work with memory</dd>
</dl>





<dl>
<dt><strong><a href="ElectricFence.html">Electric Fence</a></strong></dt>
<dd>library for find errors of work with memory</dd>
</dl>

















<p>to be continued ....</p>
