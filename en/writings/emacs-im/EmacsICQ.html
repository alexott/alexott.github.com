    <h1>Support of ICQ protocol</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<p>ICQ is very popular tool for instant messaging.  It used mostly by Windows users and also
could used from Emacs.  Now exists only one client for this protocol called <a href="http://emchat.org">emchat</a>, but
now it works only under XEmacs.  This implementation provides following functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>support of different ICQ protocols, including protocol version  8</li>
<li>registration  of new users and changing password</li>
<li>sending messages and URLs</li>
<li>users authorisation, changing of user's information and synchronisation of users list</li>
<li>obtaining users list from micq and licq configurations</li>
<li>customization of key bindings</li>
<li>extensible with Emacs Lisp functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Current implementation does not support chats and file transfer.</p>

<p>As, i don't use XEmacs, it hadn't tested this package, but installation and using of
package, described in detail in documentation. This package is in very active development,
so i think, that in near future it will implement all missing features.</p>
