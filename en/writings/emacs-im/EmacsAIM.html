<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1"></a>
Installation of package</h2>

<p class="first">You can download package from it's <a href="http://tnt.sourceforge.net/">home page</a>.  Installation of package is very simple &mdash;
just unpack downloaded archive and setup Emacs to use sources.  You can do this by putting
following commands into Emacs initialisation file:</p>

<pre class="src">
(add-to-list 'load-path <span style="color: #bc8f8f;">"path_to_tnt_dir"</span>)
(require 'tnt)
</pre>

Working with <em>TNT</em></h2>

<p class="first">To work with AIM from Emacs you need to have account.  If you don't have one, then you can
register it at <a href="http://www.aol.com/aim">AOL's site</a>.  The main work with this package go throught key bindings, that
are very easy to remember.  All commands we can split into several groups, that are
described in following subsections.</p>

<h3><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Connecting, disconnecting and changing of user status</h3>

<p class="first">To connect to AIM services you need to execute command <code>tnt-open</code> (<code>C-x t o</code>).  For this you
need to provide user name and password for your account, and if they accepted, then this
command will report, that you connected to service.  To avoid entering of password each
time, you can set it in variables <code>tnt-default-username</code> and <code>tnt-default-password</code>.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>After connecting, user can do all standard things &mdash; receive and send messages, chatting,
etc.</p>

<p>To disconnect from AIM you need to run command <code>tnt-kill</code> (<code>C-x t q</code>).</p>

<p>Also user can change it status from <em>Online</em> to <em>Away</em> (and back) with command <code>tnt-away-toggle</code>
(or with <code>C-x t A</code>).  You can customize message, that will send to users, that try to send
you messages when you has <em>Away</em> status.</p>


<h3><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Messaging</h3>

<p><em>TNT</em>  supports two type of messaging &mdash;  user-to-user messaging and chatting.</p>

<p>For user-to-user communication there is command <code>tnt-im</code> (binded to <code>C-x t i</code>) that sends
message to another user. You will asked user name with which you want communicate, and
after connecting, new buffer will opened, where you can input your messages and read
answers.  If user name is saved in your users list, then you can use completion during
entering user's name.</p>

<p>To start chatting you need to run command <code>tnt-join-chat</code> (or <code>C-x t j</code>).  You wil asked about
name of chat room.  You can input name of existing chat room, or create new one. If chat
room does not exists, then it will created.  As for user-to-user messaging, new buffer
will created, where all things could be done.  To leave chat room you need to run command
<code>tnt-leave-chat</code> (<code>C-x t l</code>).</p>

<p>If you receive invitation to chat room, or message from another user, you can accept it
with <code>tnt-accept</code> command (<code>C-x t a</code>) or reject it with <code>tnt-reject</code> command (<code>C-x t r</code>) &mdash; this
can useful when you busy, or doesn't want to chat with some users.  If you receive several
messages, they are stored in queue and you can move between them with commands
<code>tnt-next-event</code> (<code>C-x t n</code>) &mdash; to get next message, and <code>tnt-prev-event</code> (<code>C-x t p</code>) &mdash; to get
previous message.</p>


<h3><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Misc commands</h3>

<p class="first">You can create list of users to input their names quickly.  To see current list of users
you can use command <code>tnt-show-buddies</code> (<code>C-x t b</code>), and to edit it, use command
<code>tnt-edit-buddies</code> (<code>C-x t B</code>).  Names from list of users, could be used for completing user
names, when this need.</p>

<p><em>TNT</em> can also work as AIM-to-email gateway.  This is very handy, if you want to receive
messages from AIM on your email address.  You can do this with command <code>tnt-toggle-email</code>
(<code>C-x t M</code>).  You also need to set two variables <code>tnt-email-to-pipe-to</code> and <code>tnt-email-binary</code>.</p>

<p>If you have several accounts, you can switch between them with <code>tnt-switch-user</code> (<code>C-x t s</code>)
command.  The command <code>tnt-mute</code> (<code>C-x t m</code>) switch on and off audio signals, that used by <em>TNT</em>
to notify user about messages.</p>



<h2><a name="sec6" id="sec6"></a>
Package customisation</h2>

<p class="first">You can customise <em>TNT</em> using standard Emacs customisation functions (and of course, with
Emacs Lisp).  To make customisation you can use command <code>M-x tnt-customize</code>, or <code>M-x
customize-group tnt</code>.  All settings, that user can modify described in file <code>README</code> that
come with <em>TNT</em> package.</p>

<h3><a name="sec7" id="sec7"></a>
Login customisation</h3>

<p><em>TNT</em> allow user to use several accounts simultaneously.  Name and password are stored in
variables <code>tnt-default-username</code> and <code>tnt-default-password</code>.  If you has several accounts,
then you can put it into variable <code>tnt-username-alist</code>, that is associative list.  But you
should care, that these data stored in file as plain text, so your data could be read by
other users, if you'll set improper access rights to file with settings.</p>


<h3><a name="sec8" id="sec8"></a>
Audio settings</h3>

<p><em>TNT</em> allows user to customize audio signals, that used for different events.  For each of
event exist variable with name <code>tnt-beep-on-...</code>, for example <code>tnt-beep-on-incoming-message</code>
will be used for notification on new incoming messages.  Besides this, you could also
specify which program will be used to play these files (variable <code>tnt-sound-exec</code>) and
arguments, that will be passed to this program (variable <code>tnt-sound-exec-args</code>).</p>



<hr>
<p class="footnote"><a class="footnum" name="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1.</a> You can also use several accounts. To get more detail information about this, see
section about package customization.</p>
