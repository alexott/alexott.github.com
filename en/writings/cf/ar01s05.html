    and outgoing traffic.  But, for each direction we need to solve different tasks—
    for incoming traffic we need to implement protection against malware, SPAM &amp;
    phishing, but for outgoing traffic we need to take control over contents of outgoing
    documents— preventing information leakage, etc.</p><p>Most of the existing products provide control only for incoming traffic.  This
    usually made via integration with anti-virus systems, implementing different
    approaches to detect SPAM and phishing.  Some of these functions often integrated into
    e-mail clients.  For protecting users from SPAM, currently used different
    methods:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>comparison of incoming mail with existing database of SPAM messages.
      For comparison could be used different methods, like a genetic algorithms, as
      spamers try to mask their messages by replacing letters in words by numbers and vice
      verse;</p></li><li><p>dynamic categorization of messages by their content.  This method is
      very effective for detecting SPAM messages.  For make this method impossible,
      spamers send text as a pictures, and/or add word corpus not belonging to the SPAM
      messages.  Usage of these methods make dynamic categorization less precise.  But
      now, some manufacturers of anti-spam solutions start to introduce new methods, like
      a wavelet analysis and/or OCR;</p></li><li><p>gray, white &amp; black access lists allow to describe rules of mail
      receiving from well-known or unknown sites.  Usage of gray lists could stop SPAM
      messages, due existing of some peculiar features of SPAM sending software.  For
      black list could be used and local databases, controlled by e-mail administrator,
      and global lists, that updated by external users.  But usage of global black lists
      could be dangerous, as they also can contain big networks with "good"
      severs.</p></li></ol></div><p>For preventing data leakage could be used different methods, based on
    interception of e-mail messages and performing deep analysis of them according complex
    security policies.  In this case we need to perform precise detection of content
    types, languages and encodings, performing semantic analysis of the texts.</p><p>E-mail filtering systems could also used for task of creating encrypted e-mail
    streams, when system automatically encrypt outgoing message, and check and decrypt
    incoming.  This is very useful, when you want to control all e-mails, but their should
    be encrypted when transferred via public channels.</p></div><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">
