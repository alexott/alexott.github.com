    They provide quick exchange of messages between employees and/or clients of company.
    This lead to creation of tools, that control exchange of instant messages, and could
    prevent information leakage and malware propagation.</p><p>Now most popular instant messaging products (and corresponding protocols) are
    MSN (Microsoft Network), ICQ, AIM (AOL Instant Messaging), Yahoo! Chat, Jabber and
    their corporate analogs— Microsoft Live Communication Server (LCS), IBM
    SameTime and Yahoo Corporate Messaging Server.  All these products provide almost same
    functionality— sending of messages (both via central server, and direct from
    user to user) and files.  Now, almost all products also support transmission of voice
    and video between computers.  For filtering systems this lead to requirement of VoIP
    analysis.</p><p>Usually, products for control of instant messaging implemented as application
    level gateway, that perform analysis of data, and blocking inappropriate traffic.  But
    there is also implementations, that use application servers extended with content
    filtering features.  For filtering of instant messaging following functions of
    filtering products are most important:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>controlling usage of certain protocols;</p></li><li><p>control names and versions of used clients;</p></li><li><p>providing access only for certain users;</p></li><li><p>allow to contact only with users inside company and/or only with certain
      users outside company;</p></li><li><p>checking of transferred texts;</p></li><li><p>checking of transferred files for size and content
      types;</p></li><li><p>setting different policies for different directions of data
      transfer;</p></li><li><p>checking for malware;</p></li><li><p>SPIM detection;</p></li><li><p>saving of transferred data for additional checks and
      archiving.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now exists following products for content filtering of instant messaging (not
    all, but most well known):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>CipherTrust IronIM by Secure Computing.  This product support  AIM,
      MSN, Yahoo! Chat, Microsoft LCS and IBM SameTime protocols.  Now this is one of the
      most powerful products;</p></li><li><p>IM Manager by Symantec (was developed by IMLogic, that was acquired
      by Symantec).  This product provide analysis of Microsoft LCS, AIM, MSN, IBM
      SameTime, ICQ and Yahoo! Chat protocols;</p></li><li><p>Antigen for Instant Messaging from Microsoft also allow to analyse
      almost all popular instant messaging protocols.</p></li></ol></div><p>Products of other companies (ScanSafe, ContentKeeper) has less features
    comparing with products, listed above.  I need also to mention two Russian
    companies— "Gran Pri" (with product "SL-ICQ") and "Mera.ru" (with product
    "Sormovich"), that has products for filtering of instant messages transferred with ICQ
    protocol.</p></div><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">
