    tendency to implement different functions in one device or software product.  Usually,
    developers try to create solutions, that besides the content filtering functions, also
    works as anti-viruses, firewalls and/or intrusion detection and prevention systems.
    From one side, this minimize costs for companies on purchasing and support of such
    solutions, but from other side— such products, often has restricted
    functionality.  For example, in many products, functions for filtering of web-traffic
    are limited only to checking of URLs against some predefined database of URLs.</p><p>This trend is also applicable for development of products according the Unified
    Threat Management (<acronym class="acronym">UTM</acronym>) concept, that provide unified approach to
    preventing different threats, not depending on what protocol or data is processed.
    This approach allow to avoid duplication of security functions, and also to provide an
    updated threat definitions for all parts of product.</p><p>In well known branches of content filtering— e-mail- and web-filtering,
    also occur a changes and appear new technologies.  In e-mail filtering products, one
    of main function become a protection from phishing.  And in web-filtering, focus is
    changing from using predefined URLs databases to on-line data categorisation, that is
    very actual when users works with different portal solutions.</p><p>Besides, this two well-known application of content filtering, also created a
    new branches— some time ago also was created products for control of instant
    messaging and peer-to-peer (p2p) communications.  Currently, actively developed
    products for controlling of Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic.</p><p>In many countries, was started to actively develop products for the interception
    and analysis of the different kinds of information for the purpose of investigations
    (lawful interception).  This happens at the government level and in most cases used
    for anti-terror investigations.  Such systems, intercept and analyse not only data,
    transferred via computer networks, but also via usual communication channels—
    phones, radio-channels, etc.  Most widely known intercept system is Echelon— the
    system, that was used by American agencies for the collecting different kinds of
    information.  In Russia, also exists different implementations of the system for
    operative investigations (Russian abbreviation is SORM), that used by special agencies
    for intercepting and analysing information.</p><p>One of the main trends at the market of the content filtering products is very
    aggressive acquisitions.  Although this trend has mostly organisational form, but this
    could lead to creation of new products and branches for companies, that had no such
    products, or their had a very little market place.  We can illustrate this trend with
    following examples:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Secure Computing Corporation, that had acquired Cyberguard company with
        number of good products for content filtering, in summer 2006 also had acquired
        the CipherTrust company, that provide many solutions for filtering e-mail and
        instant messaging;</p></li><li><p>MailFrontier company, that had created different products for securing
        e-mail, was acquired by SonicWall, that hadn't at that time such products;</p></li><li><p>in July 2006 SurfControl, well known by their content filtering solutions,
        had acquired the BlackSpider, that provide for customers managed security
        services;</p></li><li><p>in August 2006, happens most vast acquisition— the Internet Security
        Systems (ISS) company had signed agreement with IBM about fusion.  This fusion
        demonstrate very high interest to the information security branch from the big
        companies;</p></li><li><p>In January 2007, Cisco had acquired IronPort, that had very good line of
        products for e-mail security;</p></li><li><p>In September of 2006, Websense had acquired the Port Authority Technologies
        Inc, and enter to market of data leak prevention;</p></li><li><p>Last years Microsoft had acquired different companies, that had worked in
        branch of computer &amp; information security.  Biggest of them was acquiring of
        Sybari with their anti-virus products, and also products for content filtering of
        mail and instant messaging.</p></li></ol></div><p>I should to mention, that last time, also was created a open source products for
    content filtering.  In many cases, their doesn't have same functional as commercial
    products, but exists a branches, where they successfully used.</p></div><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">
