    targets for that are both ordinary users, and companies, independent on their size.
    Now, most actual threats are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Phishing— widespread threat, aimed in stealing important user
        information (passwords, credit card numbers, etc.).  Usually this performed by
        sending special e-mail or IM messages, with URLs, that point to the fake sites,
        with the same design, as original;</p></li><li><p>Spyware— different tools, that try to hijack control over your data,
        and/or your computer.  There is different types of these tools, that
        differentiated by the degree of danger— from simple demonstration of ads, to
        logging of all data, that user enters, and hijacking control on computers
        work;</p></li><li><p>Viruses, and other types of malware— well known treats for
        IT-infrastructure.  But, every year, we got new types of malware, that often work
        via software vulnerabilities, that allow them propagate automatically;</p></li><li><p>SPAM and SPIM— unwanted messages, that users get via e-mail (SPAM) or
        instant messaging (SPIM). This lead to additional time spending for handling these
        unwanted messages by users. Currently, as SPAM marked more than 70% of all
        e-mails;</p></li><li><p>attacks on IT-infrastructure— IT-infrastructure of companies, is very
        important for work of entire company, and attacks aimed to stop it work, is very
        dangerous.  Last time, very often used distributed attacks, that involve big
        networks of computers, infected by Trojan horses or other malware, that used to
        control work of computers;</p></li><li><p>leakage of business information— prevention of such treats is one of
        the main tasks of content filtering products.  Leakage of important information,
        could lead to very high loss, often comparable with loss of main funds.  So,
        currently in many products, extending functions for detection of hidden channels
        of information leakage, such as steganography;</p></li></ol></div><p>For first five threats targets are home and corporate computers.  But, the last
    mostly applicable for companies.</p></div><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">
