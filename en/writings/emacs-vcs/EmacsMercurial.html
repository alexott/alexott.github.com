<p>In Emacs support of <em>Mercurial</em> implemented by two packages.  In <em>Mercurial's</em> distribution
exists package <em>mercurial.el</em>, that implement <em>native</em> support, and described in this
document.  There is also support for <em>Mercurial</em> in the <em>DVC</em> package, that described in
<a href="EmacsDVC.html">section about DVC</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1"></a>
Installation</h2>

<p class="first">To install the package you need to copy the file <code>mercurial.el</code> from <code>contrib</code> directory in
the <em>Mercurial's</em> distribution into place, where Emacs could find it, and put following
command into Emacs's initialization file<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #00008b;">mercurial</span>)
</pre>

Work with package</h2>

<p><em>Mercurial.el</em> use almost same principles as the VC package (i need to mention, that VC also
support work with <em>Mercurial</em>) and use almost same key bindings as VC does.  <em>mercurial.el</em> &mdash;
minor mode, that add some number of commands to perform base tasks with repository.</p>

<p>Some of commands also has global key bindings (by default this is <code>C-c h</code>, but it could be
changed by user), and other commands available only inside buffer for which <code>hg-mode</code> is
enabled.  For some commands user can use prefix argument and this allow him to set
additional parameters interactively.  User can get help on commands and key bindings
provided by <em>mercurial.el</em> with <code>hg-help-overview</code> (<code>C-c h h</code>) command.</p>

<p>To view changes user can use either the <code>hg-diff</code> (<code>C-x v =</code>) command, that show
changes for current file, either the <code>hg-diff-repo</code> (<code>C-c h =</code>) command, that
show changes for whole repository.  Both commands create additional buffer in which
changes are displayed.  To close this buffer just press <code>q</code> key.</p>

<p>Committing of changes is performed with <code>hg-commit-start</code> command, that has two key
bindings: local &mdash; 
<code>C-x v n</code>, and global &mdash; 
<code>C-c h c</code>.  During execution of this command
<em>mercurial.el</em> creates a new buffer, in which user can enter commit message, that will
written to log.  In addition to user's commit message, in this buffer also displayed list
of files for which changes will committed.  By default commit will affect all files, but
user can change this list by moving cursor to file and switch selection (shown as a bold
face) with <code>SPC</code> or <code>RET</code> keys (or with middle mouse button).  On the picture below you can
see work with this buffer.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="mercurial-el.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In buffer, created by <code>hg-commit-start</code> function, work special mode called <code>hg-commit-mode</code>.
It use several special key bindings, that could be used by user.  As in many other modes
<code>C-c C-c</code> key binding is used to initiate commit operation using user's text as a commit
message.  The <code>C-c C-k</code> key binding aborts the commit process.  And <code>C-x v =</code>
could be used to view changes in this commit.</p>

<p>To revert made changes user can also use one of two commands: <code>hg-revert-buffer</code> (<code>C-x v u</code>)
command cancel changes only for current file, and the <code>hg-revert</code> (<code>C-c h U</code>) command do this
for all modified files in repository.</p>

<p>To add a new file to repository you can use <code>hg-add</code> (<code>C-c h a</code>) command.  By default it add
current file to repository, but if you give it prefix argument, then it will ask for name
of file to add.  And the <code>hg-forget</code> (<code>C-c h f</code>) command (it not implement) could be used to
cancel addition of new file (if you hasn't committed it yet).</p>

<p>To view status of files in repository user can use the <code>hg-status</code> (<code>C-c h s</code>) command, but in
distinction from other packages, it doesn't allowed to perform commands with retrieved
data.  To view history of changes for concrete file could be used the <code>hg-log</code> (<code>C-x v l</code>)
command.  To view change log for whole repository exists separate command called
<code>hg-log-repo</code> (<code>C-c h l</code>).  There is also the <code>hg-annotate</code> (<code>C-x v a</code>) command, that could be
used to view annotated source code with version marks.</p>

<p>Besides this base operation, the <em>mercurial.el</em> package also provide base commands for
working with branches and remote repositories.  The <code>hg-incoming</code> (<code>C-c h ,</code>) command allow
user to view of changes existing in remote repository. The <code>hg-pull</code> (<code>C-c h &lt;</code>)
and hg-update (<code>C-c h u</code>) commands perform downloading and applying changes to current
repository.  There are also commands <code>hg-outgoing</code> (<code>C-c h .</code>) and <code>hg-push</code> (<code>C-c h &gt;</code>) that
allow to view which changes are missed in remote repository and push them to it.</p>


<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Customization</h2>

<p class="first">User can customize behaviour of package using standard Emacs customization routines.
Corresponding customization group has name <code>mercurial</code>.  User can change, for example,
prefix key for global key bindings (by default this is <code>C-c h</code>).</p>

<p>User can use several hooks for customize behaviour of different modes, used by
<em>mercurial.el</em>.  <code>hg-commit-mode-hook</code> will called after creating a buffer, used for entering
of commit message.  And <code>hg-pre-commit-hook</code> will called <em>after</em> entering of commit message
and <em>before</em> performing actual commit.  <code>hg-log-mode-hook</code> called after creating a buffer that
show log information (as result calling <code>hg-log-repo</code> and <code>hg-log</code> commands).  And user can
also define <code>hg-mode-hook</code>, that will called when <code>hg-mode</code> will enabled for given buffer.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a class="footnum" name="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1.</a> Latest version of <em>mercurial.el</em> you can download from repository, link to which you can
find at <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MercurialMode">Mercurial's page on Emacs WiKi</a>.</p>
