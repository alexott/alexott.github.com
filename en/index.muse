* What I do

My main work -- software development, starting from its architecture, and finishing in
implementation and marketing activity.  Besides this, I do consulting of external
projects.  Currently my specialization are information & data security (including
[[cf/index][content filtering]]), with application of big data & machine learning technologies.

At work and at home I working on different projects, using different programming
languages.  My main languages at work are [[cpp/index][C & C++]], but I also use [[./clojure][Clojure]], Lisp, Scheme,
Haskell, and other [[fp/index][functional programming]] languages.

For a long time (more than 10 years) I have been working with Unix-like operating systems --
Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X.

I use [[emacs/index][Emacs editor]], for most of my tasks -- from programming to mail reading and Internet
surfing.

I wrote many articles on different topics -- about content filtering, Emacs, and
programming.  List of articles you can find in [[writings/index]["Articles" section]].  Besides writing
articles, I participate in different [[oss/index][open source projects]].
