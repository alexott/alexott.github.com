Basics of test-driven development</h2>

<h3><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
Test-driven development</h3>

<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">Test-driven development</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>) is a software development process that relies on the
repetition of a very short development cycle:</p>

<ul>
<li>first the developer writes a failing test case that defines a desired improvement or new function;</li>
<li>then produces code to pass the test;</li>
<li>and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">extreme programming</a>, and often linked to agile programming approach. In its pure form, TDD
has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Benefits">benefits</a>, but it also has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Vulnerabilities">drawbacks</a>.  But we can use some practices to improve quality
of code in our projects.</p>

<p>TDD workflow could be described as repetition of following steps (shown on picture):</p>

<ul>
<li>define which feature should be implemented;</li>
<li>add a test(s) for defined use cases;</li>
<li>compile, run tests and check do we have any error;</li>
<li>write the code, make test work;</li>
<li>refactor code;</li>
<li>repeat tests, fix the code if there are failing tests;</li>
<li>commit changes;</li>
<li>switch to next feature (repeat all process starting from first step).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Unit testing and frameworks</h3>

<p class="first">As you know, software testing includes many different forms of tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>unit tests;</li>
<li>integration tests;</li>
<li>regression tests;</li>
<li>acceptance tests;</li>
<li>performance tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article we'll talk mostly about unit testing, although some of these techniques
could be also used for other test types.</p>

<p>Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine
if they are correctly working. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In
procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. Unit tests are
usually created by developers.  The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the
program, and show that the individual parts are correctly working.  A unit test is a
strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy.</p>

<p>Use of unit tests has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>facilitate changes &mdash; unit tests allow programmers to refactor code at a later date,
and be sure that code still works correctly;</li>
<li>simplify integration &mdash; unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the units themselves and
can be used in a bottom-up testing style approach. By testing the parts of a program
first, and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier;</li>
<li>unit testing provides a sort of living documentation for the system. Developers can
look at the unit test's code to gain a basic understanding of implemented API.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit testing frameworks</h4>

<p class="first">To simplify development of unit tests, unit test frameworks are usually used. Unit testing
framework should provide following functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing of unit tests should be simple and obvious for new users.</li>
<li>Framework should allow advanced users to perform nontrivial tests.</li>
<li>Test module should be able to have many small test cases and developer should be able
to group them into test suites.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the development users may want to see verbose and descriptive error
message, whereas during the regression testing they may just want only to know if are
any failed tests.</li>
<li>For small test modules execution time should prevail over compilation time: users don't
want to wait a minute to compile a test that takes a second to run.</li>
<li>For long running and complex tests users may want to be able to see the test's
progress.</li>
<li>Execution of individual tests should be independent on other tests. For example,
termination (crashing) of one test shouldn't lead to skipping of all other tests.</li>
<li>Simple tests shouldn't require an external library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost any programming language now has several unit testing frameworks.  The most widely
spread are frameworks from so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit">xUnit</a> family of frameworks (JUnit, CppUnit, NUnit,
etc.).  Frameworks from this family are very simple in use, and share common features &amp;
architecture.  Each of such frameworks consists from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assertions, that check individual conditions;</li>
<li>Test cases, that combine several assertions, based on some common functionality;</li>
<li>Test suites, that combine several tests, logically related to each other;</li>
<li>Fixtures, that provide setup of data or state, needed for execution of some tests, and
cleanup of state and/or data after test is finished. (Some frameworks provide separate
per-test case, per-test suite, and/or global fixtures)</li>
<li>Frameworks also include execution monitor, that controls how tests are executed, and
collects data about failed tests.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How to organize tests</h4>

<p class="first">Usually unit tests should be created for all publicly exposed functions &mdash; free functions
not declared as <code>static</code>, and all public functions of classes, including public constructors
and operators.  Unit tests should cover all main paths through functions, including
different branches of conditionals, loops, etc.  Your unit test should handle both
trivial, and edge cases, providing wrong and/or random data, so you will be able to test
error handling.  You can find more advices on unit tests code organization
<a href="http://geosoft.no/development/unittesting.html">in following article</a>.</p>

<p>Test cases are often combined into test suites by some criteria &mdash; common functionality,
different use cases for same functions, common fixtures, etc.  Fixtures are used to
perform setup and cleanup of data that are needed to perform test cases &mdash; this also
allows unit tests to be very short and easy to understand.</p>

<p>There are some recommended ways to implement tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>your test case should test only one thing;</li>
<li>test case should be short;</li>
<li>test should run fast, so it will possible to run it very often;</li>
<li>each test should work independent on other tests. Broken test shouldn't prevent other
tests from execution;</li>
<li>tests shouldn't be dependent on order of their execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people argues, that combining of all test cases into big functions, improves
readability of code, and make it more concise.  But there are arguments against this
approach (some of them are mentioned in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide/test-organization.html">following document</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>if fatal error happens, or an exception is thrown by some check, then the rest of tests
will be skipped and there is no way to prevent this;</li>
<li>there is no way to perform only checks for a particular subsystem of the tested unit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Testability of code also depends on its design.  Sometimes it's very hard to write unit
tests, because functionality to be tested is hidden behind many interfaces, or there are many
dependencies, so it's hard to setup test correctly.  There are some suggestions on how
code should be written to allow easier writing of unit tests for it:</p>

<ul>
<li>code should be loosely coupled &mdash; class or function should have as few dependencies as
possible;</li>
<li>avoid creation of particular instances of complex classes inside your class. It's
better to pass pointers/references to these classes to your class/function &mdash; this will
allow to use mocking to test your code;</li>
<li>you should try to minimize public API that is provided by class &mdash; it's better to write
several classes, that perform separate tasks, instead of creating one class, that does
everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>More advices on writing testable code you can find in <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html">following blog post</a>.</p>



<h3><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Mocking</h3>

<p class="first">In a unit test, mock objects can simulate behavior of complex, real (non-mock) objects and
they are very useful when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a
unit test. If an object has any of the following characteristics, it may be useful to use
a mock object instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplies non-deterministic results (e.g., current time or current temperature);</li>
<li>has states that are difficult to create or reproduce (e.g. a network error);</li>
<li>slow (e.g. a complete database, which would have to be initialized before the test);</li>
<li>does not exist yet, or may change behavior;</li>
<li>would have to include information and methods exclusively for testing purposes (and not
for its actual task).</li>
</ul>

<p>Mock objects have the same interface as real objects they mimic, allowing a client object
to remain unaware of whether it's using a real object, or a mock object. Many available
mock object frameworks allow the programmer to specify which, and in what order, methods
will be invoked on a mock object, and what parameters will be passed to them, as well as
what values that will be returned.  Thus, the behavior of a complex object, such as a
network socket, can be emulated by a mock object, allowing the programmer to discover
whether the object being tested responds appropriately to the wide variety of states, such
objects may be in.</p>

<p>Typical workflow looks following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>you should have an interface for class that you will test, so you can have mocked class
and real-world class;</li>
<li>you create a mocked class using some framework (you can also write it yourself, but
it's bad idea);</li>
<li>you have a code, that you want to test against mocked object;</li>
<li>you create a test case that will use your mocked object instead of real-world one.
Inside this test case you do following:

<ul>
<li>you create an instance of mocked class;</li>
<li>you setup behavior and expectations on mocked object &mdash; which methods should be
called (or not called), which data will be returned for particular call, etc.</li>
<li>you run your code that will use mocked object some way;</li>
<li>after execution of your code, you evaluate results of execution and check
expectations against actual results &mdash; usually this is done automatically by
framework, when mocked object is destroyed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Testing in C++</h2>

<p class="first">This section covers unit testing and mocking in C++.</p>

<h3><a name="sec6" id="sec6"></a>
Unit testing in C++ &amp; Boost.Test</h3>

<p class="first">There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C.2B.2B">many unit testing frameworks</a> for C++.  Currently most popular are Boost.Test,
and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google C++ Testing Framework</a>.  Both have similar features, but I'll cover Boost.Test
because I'm using it in work and personal projects.</p>

<p>Boost.Test has following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>It suitable for novice and advanced users</li>
<li>It allows organization of test cases into test suites</li>
<li>Test cases could be registered automatically and/or manually</li>
<li>Parametrized &amp; typed tests to test different data types</li>
<li>Fixtures (initialization and cleanup of resources): per test-case, per test-suite,
global</li>
<li>Big number of assertions/checkers:

<ul>
<li>Exceptions: Throws/Not throws</li>
<li>Equal, not equal, greater, less, etc</li>
<li>Equality checking for collections &amp; bits</li>
<li>Explicit fail/success</li>
<li>Floating point numbers comparison, including control of closeness of numbers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Different levels of checking: warning, check, require</li>
<li>Execution monitor with many options that control test's execution</li>
<li>User-defined or manually written <code>main</code> procedure</li>
<li>Declaration of which tests should fail</li>
<li>Output of results in different formats: text, xml, ...</li>
<li>Progress visualization</li>
<li>Cross-platform (works on all platforms, supported by Boost)</li>
<li>licensed under Boost License, that allows to use it anywhere without restriction</li>
<li>Has very <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf.html">good documentation</a>, including <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/tutorials.html">tutorials</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The only drawback is that it lacks of mocking features, although Google Mocking framework
could be used together with it.</p>

<p>Boost.Test could be used differently, depending on complexity of tests.  User can either
write test functions themself, and register them manually, forming a hierarchy of tests,
or he can use special macros, that will register test automatically.</p>

<p>In this text we'll use &quot;automatic&quot; tests as examples, and you can read about manual test
registration in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide.html">Boost.Test documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Usually, code written for Boost.Test, consists from several objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>test cases, that contains assertions</li>
<li>test suites, that combines several test cases into bigger object</li>
<li>fixtures, that are used to perform setup and cleanup of resources/data for test cases,
test suites and/or global context.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests are executed by <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/execution-monitor.html">Execution monitor</a> that controls execution of tests, handles errors,
and collects data about executed/failed tests.  Developer may control behaviour of
execution monitor through command-line options, environment variables, or from source
code.</p>

<h4>Tests with automatic registration</h4>

<p class="first">For simple tests the use of Boost.Test is straightforward &mdash; you include necessary header
files, and write test cases (possibly, organizing them into test suites), compile your
test, and link it with the <code>boost_unit_test_framework</code> library (it contains the <code>main</code>
function that will perform setup of tests, and their execution).</p>


<h4>Minimal test program</h4>

<p class="first">Here is minimal example, that defines one test:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #006400;">#define</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">BOOST_TEST_MODULE</span> Simple testcases
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;boost/test/unit_test.hpp&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</span>(simple_test) {
  BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(2+2, 4);
}
</pre>

<p>First line declares name of this test, second line includes necessary header file, and
lines 4-6 define test &mdash; the <code>BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</code> macro is used to define test with given
name (<code>simple_test</code>), and test's body contains one assertion: <code> 2+2 == 4</code> &mdash; this
assertion uses <code>BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL</code> macro to perform check.</p>

<p>After compilation you can run this program, and it will print following on the screen
(Boost.Test can also output results in different formats, and you can also control
verbosity of output with execution monitor's options &mdash; see below):</p>

<pre class="src">
  Running 1 test case...

  *** No errors detected
</pre>

<p>If something will go wrong, then framework will print another message on the screen:</p>

<pre class="src">
  Running 1 test case...
  test-simple.cpp(5): error in <span style="color: #008b00;">"simple_test"</span>: check 2+2 == 5 failed [4 != 5]

  *** 1 failure detected in test suite <span style="color: #008b00;">"Simple testcases"</span>
</pre>

<p>This information includes number of failures in given test program (called <code>Simple
testcases</code>), and shows where error occurred (line 5 in file <code>test-simple.cpp</code>), together with
additional information on error (this depends on what checker was used).</p>

<h5>Use of test suites</h5>

<p>If you have many test cases in one program, then their maintenance could be hard.
Boost.Test, like other frameworks, allows to group several test cases into test suite &mdash;
this allows to work with them in easier way + adds some other benefits &mdash; you can define
common fixtures for all test cases, and for example, select which tests should be
executed, using command-line options.</p>

<p>Use of test suites is very easy &mdash; you need to put the <code>BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE</code> macro (with
name of suite as an argument) before first test case, that should be included into this
test suite, and the <code>BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE_END</code> macro after last test case, that should be
included in this test suite:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #006400;">#define</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">BOOST_TEST_MODULE</span> Simple testcases 2
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;boost/test/unit_test.hpp&gt;</span>

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(suite1)

<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</span>(test1) {
    BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(2+2, 4);
}

<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</span>(test2) {
    BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(2*2, 4);
}

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE_END()
</pre>

<p>That's all &mdash; compile and run this program as before.</p>



<h4>Testing tools/Checkers</h4>

<p class="first">Boost.Test provides <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/testing-tools.html">many different testing tools</a> (&quot;Checkers&quot;).  For almost all of them,
there are several checking levels (I will use <code>&lt;level&gt;</code> placeholder instead of actual
values):</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>WARN</code></strong></dt>
<dd>produces warning message if check failed, but errors counter isn't increased and
test case continues;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>CHECK</code></strong></dt>
<dd>reports error and increases errors counter when check is failed, but test case
continues;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>REQUIRE</code></strong></dt>
<dd>similar to <code>CHECK</code>, but it's used for reporting of &quot;fatal&quot; errors.  Execution of
test case is aborted.  This check should be used for things, like checking is object,
that will be used later in the code, was created.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In basic form, the checker is a macro in form <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;[_check]</code> that receives one or
more arguments.  The only exceptions from this rule are <code>BOOST_ERROR</code> and <code>BOOST_FAIL</code> macros,
that are used to produce explicit errors (normal and fatal). Complete list of checkers you
can find in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/testing-tools/reference.html">reference</a>.</p>

<p>Basic macros (<code>BOOST_WARN</code>, <code>BOOST_CHECK</code>, and <code>BOOST_REQUIRE</code>) accept only one argument &mdash;
expression to check, like following:</p>

<pre class="src">
 BOOST_WARN( <span style="color: #a020f0;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span>) == <span style="color: #a020f0;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">short</span>) );
 BOOST_CHECK( i == 1 );
 BOOST_REQUIRE( i &gt; 5 );
</pre>

<p>If check will fail, then Boost.Test will report line in source code where this
happened, and what condition was specified.  You can also provide your own message to
output using <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_MESSAGE</code> macros.</p>

<p>But when you compare something, then it's better to use specialized macros, like
<code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_EQUAL</code>, <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_NE</code>, <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_GT</code>, etc.  The main advantage of these
macros, is that they will show you both expected, and actual value, instead of simple
message that comparison was failed (this functionality could be also used for your own
predicates, if you'll use <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_PREDICATE</code> macros).  For example, look onto
following code:</p>

<pre class="src">
 <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">i</span> = 2;
 <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">j</span> = 1;

 BOOST_CHECK( i == j );
 BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL( i, j );
</pre>

<p>the first checker will only report that check was failed:</p>

<pre class="src">
test.cpp(4): error in <span style="color: #008b00;">"test"</span>: check i == j failed
</pre>

<p>while the second checker, will report about problem, together with actual values, used in
comparison:</p>

<pre class="src">
test.cpp(5): error in <span style="color: #008b00;">"test"</span>: check i == j failed [2 != 1]
</pre>

<p>Boost.Test also provides specialized checkers for comparison of collections
(<code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_EQUAL_COLLECTION</code>), and bitwise comparison (<code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_BITWISE_EQUAL</code>).</p>

<p>Comparison of floating-point numbers with standard comparison operators isn't a good idea
(because of precision), but Boost.Test <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/testing-tools/floating_point_comparison.html">provides several macros</a> that solve this task (you
need to include additional header file to use them:
<code>boost/test/floating_point_comparison.hpp</code>): <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_CLOSE</code>,
<code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_CLOSE_FRACTION</code>, and <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_SMALL</code>.</p>

<p>In some situations, you need to check, does your code throws exception or not.  To check
that your code doesn't throw exception, you can use <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_NO_THROW</code> macro, that
receives expression, that will be evaluated, and if exception is thrown, it will perform
corresponding action, depending on level.  To check, that your code throws given
exception, you can use the <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_THROW</code> macro, that will evaluate expression (first
argument), and check, does it throws exception, and does it have correct type (exception's
type is passed as second argument).  The third macros is <code>BOOST_&lt;level&gt;_EXCEPTION</code> that
allows to check, does your code throws exception, but also allows to provide additional
checker, that will check data inside exception object, and return true or false.</p>

<p>Another task, automated by Boost.Test is <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/testing-tools/output-test.html">testing of output results</a>.  This functionality
could be used to check functionality of <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator, or similar things.  Boost.Test
provides special output class, compatible to <code>std::ostream</code>, and you can output data to it,
and explicitly get access to its content.  You can also create a file with &quot;desired
output&quot;, and use data from this file to compare against output, produced by your code.</p>

<p>In some cases, it could be also useful to get checkpoints, where test case was in normal
state.  Boost.Test provides 2 macros for this task:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT</code> macro is used to create named checkpoint with message, that
will output if error will happen &mdash; this is very useful when you're checking
expressions in loops;</li>
<li>the <code>BOOST_TEST_PASSPOINT</code> macro (without arguments) is used to create unnamed
checkpoint, and if error will happen, then line, where last checkpoint was set, will

<h4>Fixtures</h4>

<p class="first">Fixtures &mdash; special objects that are used to implement setup and cleanup of data/resources
required to execution of unit tests.  Separation of code between fixtures and actual test
code, allows to simplify unit test's code, and use the same initialization code for
different test cases and test suites.</p>

<p>Fixtures in Boost.Test are usually implemented as classes/structs where constructor
performs initialization of data, while destructor performs cleanup.  For example:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #a020f0;">struct</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">MyFixture</span> {
     <span style="color: #0000ff;">MyFixture</span>() { i = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span>;*i = 0; }
     ~ <span style="color: #0000ff;">MyFixture</span>() { <span style="color: #a020f0;">delete</span> i; }
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span>* <span style="color: #8b0000;">i</span>;
};
</pre>

<p>and you can use it following way:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</span>( test_case1 )
{
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">MyFixture</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">f</span>;
    <span style="color: #666666;">// </span><span style="color: #666666;">do something with f.i
</span>}
</pre>

<p>But Boost.Test also provides special macros that allows to simplify use of fixtures. For
test cases you can use the <code>BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE</code> macro instead of <code>BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</code>
&mdash; the only difference between them is that former has second argument (fixture name),
that will be created automatically and passed to test case.  There is also additional
advantage over direct use of fixtures in your code &mdash; you have direct access to public and
protected members of fixture, for example:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #006400;">#define</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">BOOST_TEST_MODULE</span> Test-<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> fixture example
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;boost/test/unit_test.hpp&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #a020f0;">struct</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">F</span> {
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">F</span>() : i(1) {}
    ~<span style="color: #0000ff;">F</span>() { }
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">i</span>;
};

<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE</span>(simple_test, <span style="color: #0000ff;">F</span>) {
    BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(i, 1);
}
</pre>

<p>In this case, the <code>F</code> fixture was created, it holds one variable &mdash; 
<code>i</code>, and it directly
accessible in our test case.</p>

<p>The similar functionality also provided for test suites &mdash; you just need to use the
<code>BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE</code> macro instead of <code>BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE</code>.  This macro accepts
fixture name as second parameter, and separate fixture object is created for every test in
given test suite.  <strong>You should remember, that for each test case/test suite, the new
fixture object is created, so changes in fixture from one test case won't available to
other tests (this is really a bad idea).</strong></p>

<p>There is also 3rd type of fixtures, supported by Boost.Test &mdash; global fixtures, that could
be used to perform global setup/cleanup tasks.  To use some fixture in global context you
need to use the <code>BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE</code> macro, passing fixture name to it as argument &mdash; this
will lead to creation of fixture before first test, and destruction of it after the last
test.</p>


<h4>Output of results</h4>

<p class="first">Usually Boost.Test prints only messages about errors and exceptions, but you can control
what will be printed by using different options, described below.  There are also
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide/test-output/log-ct-config.html">compile time options</a>, that allows to control output, for example, threshold level, etc.
Usually Boost.Test prints results in human-readable format, but it can also output data in
XML, so you can feed them into database, or dashboard.</p>

<p>There is also macro, that provides explicit printing of data.  The <code>BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE</code>
macro receives one argument &mdash; message to print, that will be printed together with other
messages.</p>


<h4>Execution control</h4>

<p class="first">Tests are executed by execution monitor, that takes list of registered tests, execute them
(creating fixtures, if necessary), and count number of failures.  By default execution
monitor handles all exceptions, including system problems, like wrong memory access.  But
this behaviour isn't required all the time &mdash; sometime you need to get core from the
crashed process, or run only some tests, etc.</p>

<p>Commenting out not necessary tests, or do something similar, isn't a good idea &mdash; that's
why Boost.Test provides <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide/runtime-config.html">many run-time options</a> that control behaviour of execution monitor
(some of these options also have compile-time equivalents).</p>

<p>There are two ways to specify run-time configuration option &mdash; from command line or via
setting environment variable.</p>

<p>When test program is initializing, execution monitor analyzes command-line options, and
excludes from them all options, belonging to its own configuration.  Command-line options
are specified in form <code>--&lt;option name&gt;=&lt;option value&gt;</code> (it shouldn't be space
characters between option's name and its value).  Option's names (both, command-line and
environment variables) are case-sensitive.</p>

<p>Here is list of most important options, that are recognized by test programs, that are
using standard execution monitor (in parentheses are names of corresponding environment
variables):</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><code>--auto_start_dbg</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_AUTO_START_DBG</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>(<code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, default <code>no</code>) specifies, should
Boost.Test to try to run debugger, if fatal system error occurs;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>--catch_system_errors</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_CATCH_SYSTEM_ERRORS</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>(<code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, default <code>yes</code>)
specifies, should Boost.Test to catch system errors, or not;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>--log_level</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_LOG_LEVEL</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>(<code>all</code>, <code>success</code>, <code>test_suite</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code>,
<code>cpp_exception</code>, <code>system_error</code>, <code>fatal_error</code>, or <code>nothing</code>, default is <code>error</code>) allows to
specify which messages will be printed by test program.  You can use this to see which
test is currently executing, together with related information.</dd>
<dt><strong><code>--random</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_RANDOM</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>allows to run tests in random order (use <code>0</code> to disable
this &mdash; default value). If value is greater than 1, then it's used as random seed, if
it is equal to 1, then system time is used as random seed;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>--run_test</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_RUN_TEST</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>allows to specify names of tests to be executed.
User can list test names, or use mask. See <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide/runtime-config/run-by-name.html">documentation</a> on more details and examples;</dd>
<dt><strong><code>--show_progress</code> (<code>BOOST_TEST_SHOW_PROGRESS</code>)</strong></dt>
<dd>(<code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, default <code>no</code>) specifies, should
Boost.Test display progress indicator during execution of test cases, or not.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Description of other options you can find in <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/utf/user-guide/runtime-config/reference.html">documentation</a> &mdash; they can control format of
output, which additional details will be shown, etc.</p>

<h3><a name="sec7" id="sec7"></a>
<a name="gmock-example" id="gmock-example"></a>Mocking frameworks for C++</h3>

<p class="first">There are different mocking frameworks for C++ &mdash; <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/">Google C++ mocking framework</a>,
<a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/hippomocks">HippoMocks</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/amop/">AMOP</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/turtle/index.php?title=Turtle">Turtle</a>, etc.  Google mocking framework is currently most advanced and
actively supported, so we'll use it in our example &mdash; other frameworks provide similar
functionality.</p>

<p>Google mocking framework has pretty good documentation, that is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/w/list">available as wiki</a>.  You
can find tutorial in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/ForDummies">following document</a>, and find more in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/CookBook">cookbook</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/CheatSheet">cheatsheet</a>, and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions">FAQ</a>.
In this section we'll concentrate on high-level overview of framework and will provide
small example of its use.  I assume, that google mock library is already installed on
machine.</p>

<p>Google mock follows standard workflow of mocking:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a mock object for given class &mdash; there are many macros to declare mocked
functions.  There is also a tool, that can generate mock definition from your source
code;</li>
<li>you create test case that will use your mock class, and inside it you do following:

<ul>
<li>create mock object and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/ForDummies#Setting_Expectations">set expectations</a> on it.  There are many different macros and
functions, so you can setup almost arbitrary scenario;</li>
<li>call function(s) that you want to test, and pass mock object to them as an argument (or
you can create some object, and set mock object as its member, that will be used by
its functions);</li>
<li>on destruction of mock object, Google mock library checks expectations against actual
results, and if they weren't met, then it will report error by throwing an exception,
and printing which expectation(s) were failed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's look on practical example.  To use mock test, we need to include corresponding
header file &mdash; 
<code>gmock/gmock.h</code>:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;gmock/gmock.h&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;string&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #006400;">#define</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">BOOST_TEST_MODULE</span> Mock example
<span style="color: #006400;">#include</span> <span style="color: #008b00;">&lt;boost/test/unit_test.hpp&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>We need to have class, that we'll mock.  This should be virtual class, so Google mock will
able to override methods in it:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span> {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span>:
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span>()  { }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">virtual</span> ~<span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span>() { }

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">virtual</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">SetProperty</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">const</span> <span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::<span style="color: #0000ff;">string</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">name</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">value</span>) = 0;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">virtual</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">GetProperty</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">const</span> <span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::<span style="color: #0000ff;">string</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">name</span>) = 0;
};
</pre>

<p>This class will be used by functions in another class, that will store reference to
instance of our base class <code>PropHolder</code>:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">TestClass</span> {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span>:
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">TestClass</span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">ph</span>) : fPropHolder(ph) { }
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">doCalc</span>() {
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (fPropHolder.GetProperty(<span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::string(<span style="color: #008b00;">"test"</span>)) &gt; 100) {
            fPropHolder.SetProperty(<span style="color: #008b00;">"test2"</span>, 555);
        } <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span>
            fPropHolder.SetProperty(<span style="color: #008b00;">"test2"</span>, 785);
    }
<span style="color: #a020f0;">private</span>:
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">fPropHolder</span>;
};
</pre>

<p>Now we need to create mocked class, that is inherited from <code>PropHolder</code>, and uses macros to
implement corresponding stubs.  Google mock provides different macros &mdash; 
<code>MOCK_METHODN</code>,
<code>MOCK_CONST_METHODN</code>, where last <code>N</code> should match to number of arguments of mocked function.
First argument of these macros is a name of method to mock, and second &mdash; function's
signature:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">MockPropHolder</span> : <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">PropHolder</span> {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span>:
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">MockPropHolder</span>() { }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">virtual</span> ~<span style="color: #0000ff;">MockPropHolder</span>() { }

    MOCK_METHOD2(SetProperty, <span style="color: #0000ff;">void</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">const</span> <span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::<span style="color: #0000ff;">string</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">name</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">value</span>));
    MOCK_METHOD1(GetProperty, <span style="color: #0000ff;">int</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">const</span> <span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::<span style="color: #0000ff;">string</span>&amp; <span style="color: #8b0000;">name</span>));
};
</pre>

<p>Now we can use mocked class in our test.  We create an instance of mocked class called
<code>mholder</code>, and will set expectations on it. First expectation is that function <code>GetProperty</code>
will be called once with parameter <code>&quot;test&quot;</code>, and mocked object should return <code>101</code> for this
call.  The second expectation specifies that <code>SetProperty</code> function will be called with two
arguments &mdash; 
<code>&quot;test2&quot;</code> and <code>555</code>. After setting expectation, we create an instance of our
<code>TestClass</code> and pass reference to mocked object to it.  And last line &mdash; call of function
<code>doCalc</code>, that uses functions from <code>PropHolder</code> class:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #0000ff;">BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE</span>(test_gmock) {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">using</span> ::<span style="color: #00008b;">testing</span>::Return;

    <span style="color: #0000ff;">MockPropHolder</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">mholder</span>;
    EXPECT_CALL(mholder, GetProperty(<span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::string(<span style="color: #008b00;">"test"</span>))).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(101));
    EXPECT_CALL(mholder, SetProperty(<span style="color: #00008b;">std</span>::string(<span style="color: #008b00;">"test2"</span>),555));

    <span style="color: #0000ff;">TestClass</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">t</span>(mholder);
    t.doCalc();
}
</pre>

<p>Google Mock can be used not only with Google C++ Testing framework, but also with
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/ForDummies#Using_Google_Mock_with_Any_Testing_Framework">other frameworks</a>, so we need to add code to correctly use it with Boost.Test.  We'll use
global fixture object to do this:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #a020f0;">struct</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">InitGMock</span> {
    <span style="color: #0000ff;">InitGMock</span>() {
        ::<span style="color: #00008b;">testing</span>::GTEST_FLAG(throw_on_failure) = <span style="color: #00008b;">true</span>;
        ::<span style="color: #00008b;">testing</span>::InitGoogleMock(&amp;<span style="color: #00008b;">boost</span>::<span style="color: #00008b;">unit_test</span>::<span style="color: #00008b;">framework</span>::master_test_suite().argc,
                                  <span style="color: #00008b;">boost</span>::<span style="color: #00008b;">unit_test</span>::<span style="color: #00008b;">framework</span>::master_test_suite().argv);
    }
    ~<span style="color: #0000ff;">InitGMock</span>() { }
};
BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE(InitGMock);
</pre>

<p>We also need to link additional libraries to have this code built &mdash; 
<code>gmock</code> and <code>gtest</code>.
After that we can run our test program and get results.  If everything will work
correctly, and results will match to our expectations, then we'll see standard success
message:</p>

<pre class="src">
  Running 1 test case...

  *** No errors detected
</pre>

<p>But if we'll make an error, and forgot to call <code>t.doCalc()</code>, or calculations will be made
incorrectly, then we'll get something like:</p>

<pre class="src">
  Running 1 test case...
  test-mock.cpp:62: Failure
  Actual function call count doesn't match this expectation.
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: never called - unsatisfied and active
  test-mock.cpp:63: Failure

         Expected: to be called once

  test-mock.cpp(65): last checkpoint

  *** 1 failure detected in test suite <span style="color: #008b00;">"Mock example"</span>
</pre>

<p>That's all for mocking part.  More information you can find in documentation for Google
mock framework, where you can also find many examples of its usage.</p>
